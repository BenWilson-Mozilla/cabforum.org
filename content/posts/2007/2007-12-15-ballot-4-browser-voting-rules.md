Ballot 4 – Browser Voting Rules (Passed Unanimously)

Motion

The following motion was made by Johnathan Nightingale and seconded by Bruce Morton and Jay Schiavo

‘The CABForum voting rules will be amended as follows:

The sentence: “In order for the motion to carry, two-thirds or more of the votes cast by the permanent members in the CA category must be in favor of the motion, and half or more of the votes cast by the permanent members in the browser category must be in favor of the motion” will be replaced by the sentence: “In order for the motion to carry, two-thirds or more of the votes cast by the permanent members in the CA category must be in favor of the motion, and at least 50% plus one of the votes cast by the permanent members in the browser category must be in favor of the motion”.

The modified voting rules will apply to ballots commencing after successful adoption of the motion.’

The ballot review period is in effect and will close at 1700 EST on (Saturday) 8 Dec 2007. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 1700 EST on (Saturday) 15 Dec 2007.

Votes must be cast by “reply all” to this email.

A vote in favour of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response. A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response.

Unclear responses will not be counted.

The latest vote received from a representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.
