Ballot 106 – Extended Deadline to Prohibit OCSP “Good” Response for Non-Issued Certificates (Withdrawn)

Motion

Given that several CAs have notified the CA/Browser Forum that they will be unable to comply with the 1-August-2013 deadline by which OCSP responders MUST NOT respond with a “good” status for unissued certificates, and that a one-year extension of this deadline is an appropriate timeframe by which these CAs should be able to come into compliance;

Kelvin Yiu made the following motion, and Eddy Nigg from [StartCom][1], Ryan Hurst from [GlobalSign][2], and Iida Yosiaki from SECOM, and Inigo Barreira of Izenpe endorsed it:

## Motion Begins

EFFECTIVE RETROACTIVELY TO 1 AUGUST 2013,

The last sentence of Section 13.2.6 of the Baseline Requirements (Response for non-issued certificates) is hereby amended to read as follows:

“Effective 1 August 2014, OCSP responders MUST NOT respond with a “good” status for such certificates.”

## Motion Ends

The ballot review period comes into effect immediately upon posting today (Tuesday, 23 July 2013) and will close at 2200 UTC on Tuesday, 30 July 2013. Unless the ballot is withdrawn or modified during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 2200 UTC on Tuesday, 6 August 2013. If the ballot is modified for reasons other than to correct minor typographical errors, then the ballot will be deemed to have been withdrawn.

Votes must be cast by posting an on-list reply to this thread.

A vote in favor of the ballot must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response.

A vote against the ballot must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted. The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.
