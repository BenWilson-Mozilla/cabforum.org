## Ballot 111 – Accelerate Max Certificate Lifetime Reduction Timetable

Gervase Markham (Mozilla) made the following motion, endorsed by Eddy Nigg from StartCom and Ryan Hurst from Globalsign:

— Motion begins —

The CAB Forum wishes to take advantage of the /de facto/ deprecation of the near-ubiquitous SHA-1 hash algorithm in the Web PKI and its 1 January 2017 retirement by accelerating the Forum’s planned move to shorter maximum certificate lifetimes, in order to attain a more agile certificate ecosystem.

Therefore, effective immediately, the Baseline Requirements are altered as follows:

Update section 9.4.1 to change both occurrences of “1 April 2015” to “1 April 2014”.

Update the Relevant Compliance Dates table on page ii to change 2015-04-01 to 2014-04-01 in the appropriate line.

… Motion ends …

The ballot review period comes into effect immediately upon posting today (Tuesday 26 November 2013) and will close at 2200 UTC on Tuesday 5 December 2013. Unless the ballot is withdrawn or modified during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 2200 UTC on Tuesday, 12 December 2013. If the ballot is modified during such voting period for reasons other than to correct minor typographical errors, then the ballot will be deemed to have been withdrawn.

Votes must be cast by posting an on-list reply to this thread.

A vote in favor of the ballot must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response.

A vote against the ballot must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted. The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.

In order for the motion to be adopted, two thirds or more of the votes cast by members in the CA category and more than one half of the votes cast by members in the browser category must be in favor. Also, quorum is currently set at 6 members– at least 6 members must participate in the ballot, either by voting in favor, voting against, or by abstaining for the vote to be valid.
