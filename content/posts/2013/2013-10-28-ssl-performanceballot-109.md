## Ballot 109 – Create SSL Performance Working Group

Voting on Ballot 109 has closed. Seventeen voted in favor – Buypass, Comodo, DigiCert, Disig, GlobalSign, GoDaddy, QuoVadis, SECOM, SSC, StartCom, Symantec, Trustis , TURKTRUST, Google, Microsoft, Opera, and Mozilla. There were no abstentions and none opposed. Therefore, Ballot 109 passes.

Gervase Markham (Mozilla) made the following motion, endorsed by Rick Andrews from Symantec, Richard Wang from WoSign, Ben Wilson from DigiCert, and Ryan Hurst from GlobalSign:

— Motion begins —

The CAB Forum shall create a Working Group, to be known as the SSL Performance Working Group.

Scope: the Working Group shall consider all matters having a bearing on software deployments which use SSL and the Web PKI. Examples might include: certificate contents, choice of proposed ciphers, webserver configuration, and OCSP configuration.

Deliverables: the Working Group shall produce one or more documents giving best practice guidance for getting the best performance from a SSL deployment which uses the Web PKI while still providing acceptable levels of security. The expectation is that such documentation will be submitted to the Forum for publication as (a) non-binding Forum document(s).

Expiration Date: the Working Group shall expire twenty-seven months (“one EV”) from the passing of this resolution, unless extended by a further ballot of the Members, such a ballot to specify the extension period and any necessarily modifications of the scope and deliverables.

… Motion ends …
