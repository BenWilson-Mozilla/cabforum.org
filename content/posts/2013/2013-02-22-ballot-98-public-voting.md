Ballot 98 – Public Voting (Passed)

Motion

Gervase Markham made the following motion, and Jeremy Rowley and Kirk Hall endorsed it:

… Motion Begins …

The CAB Forum wishes to require that the votes of Members on CAB Forum ballots be public information. For avoidance of doubt, a consequence of this change is that the voting information for ballots will be public. Therefore, effective immediately, the CAB Forum Bylaws\[0\] are updated as follows:

… Erratum Begins …

- Delete bullet b) of section 5.1 (“Member Mail List and Member Web Site”) in its entirety, and reletter the following sections.

- Update bullet c) of section 5.2 (“Public Mail List and Public Web Site”) to read:

“Messages formally proposing a Forum ballot (including ballots to establish, modify, or terminate Working Groups), individual votes, vote and quorum counts, and messages announcing ballot outcomes and voting breakdowns.”

… Erratum ends …

The review period for this ballot shall commence at 21:00 UTC on 8 February 2013 and will close at 21:00 UTC on 15 February 2013. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 21:00 UTC on 22 February 2013. Votes must be cast by posting an on-list reply to this thread.

… Motions ends …

A vote in favor of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response.

A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted. The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.
