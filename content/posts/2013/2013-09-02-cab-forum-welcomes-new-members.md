title: CA/B Forum Welcomes New Members
type: post
---

Since May 2013, five new Certificate Authorities have joined the CA/Browser Forum. We welcome the following global companies:

- AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus
- Disig, a.s.
- Firmaprofesional
- Prvni certifikacni autorita, a.s.
- WoSign

Each new member has met the CA/B Forum requirements in issuing publicly trusted SSL certificates, undergoing a 3rd party audit, and has signed the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policy. The new members represent geographically diverse Certificate Authorities from Estonia, Slovakia, Spain, Czech Republic and China. We look forward to enhancing the overall knowledge base of the CA/B Forum with these additional members. This brings the total membership to 45 Certificate Authorities and Browsers.
