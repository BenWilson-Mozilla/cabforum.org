Ballot 101 – Section 11.10.2 of EV Guidelines – Accountant Licensing (Passed)

Motion

Ryan Koski made the following motion, and Ben Wilson from DigiCert and Rich Smith from Comodo endorsed it:

Motion Begins

EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, in order to eliminate a conflict in the Extended Validation Guidelines between the definition of Accounting Practitioner in Section 4 (Definitions) mentioning “country” and the specific requirements for verifying the status of Accounting Practitioners in 11.10.2(1)(A) which does not, and to clarify the requirement, we propose amending section 11.10.2 as follows:

DELETE

(A) Status of Author: The CA MUST verify that the accountant letter is authored by an independent Accounting Practitioner retained by and representing the Applicant (or an in-house professional accountant employed by the Applicant) who is a certified public accountant, chartered accountant, or has an equivalent license within the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation, Jurisdiction of Registration, or the jurisdiction where the Applicant maintains an office or physical facility. Verification of license MUST be through that jurisdiction’s member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) or through the regulatory organization in that jurisdiction appropriate to contact when verifying an accountant’s license to practice in that jurisdiction.

and INSERT:

(A) Status of Author: The CA MUST verify that the accountant letter is authored by an Accounting Practitioner retained or employed by the Applicant and licensed within the country of the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation, Jurisdiction of Registration, or country where the Applicant maintains an office or physical facility. Verification of license MUST be through the member organization or regulatory organization in the Accounting Practitioner’s country or jurisdiction that is appropriate to contact when verifying an accountant’s license to practice in that country or jurisdiction. Such country or jurisdiction must have an accounting standards body that maintains full membership status with the International Federation of Accountants.
