## Announcing the formation of the Performance Working Group – Call for Participants

The CA/Browser Forum has chartered a Performance Working Group, the purpose of which is to review certificate contents, choice of proposed ciphers, webserver configuration, and OCSP configuration for best practice guidance for performance while still providing acceptable levels of security. The CA/Browser Forum would like to invite interested third parties to participate. The working group meets bi-weekly by phone and expects to hold face to face meetings coinciding with the regular CA/Browser Forum meetings.

Interested parties will need to:

1. Review the Intellectual Property Rights policy ([/IPR_Policy_V1.pdf](/IPR_Policy_V1.pdf)) and complete the IPR agreement which can be found here: [/IPR_Agreement_V1.pdf](/IPR_Agreement_V1.pdf)
1. Send an email to questions@cabforum.org with your name, organization (if applicable), contact details and the signed agreement with the subject: Performance Working Group Participation

Once the Chair determines all is in order, you will be added to the mailing list and invited to the conference calls.

As the title of this group states, this is a Working Group, meaning everyone is expected to contribute in some fashion. Please do not apply if you can’t devote time to attend and participate in the discussion.
