Ballot 40 – Terms of Use (Passed Unanimously)

Motion

Ben Wilson made the following motion, and Doug Pelton and Brian Trzupek endorsed it:

The treatment of parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries in the EV Guidelines does not accommodate the realities of most large corporate infrastructures and should be redefined. Also, according to some interpretations of contract law principles, an entity cannot enter into an artificial and unenforceable reciprocal contract with itself (i.e., no arms-length exchange of promises as consideration to make the agreement binding, etc.), so it is proposed that a CA issuing Certificates internally have an Applicant Representative accept “Terms of Use” that are equivalent to a Subscriber Agreement.
