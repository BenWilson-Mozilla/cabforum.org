Ballot 44 – IFAC Membership (Passed Unanimously)

Motion

Ben Wilson made the following motion, and Eddy Nigg and Bruce Morton endorsed it:

The existing definition of “Accounting Practitioner” contemplates that an Accounting Practitioner is licensed by an entity that is a member of the International Federation of Accountants. IFAC Membership is not restricted to licensing and regulatory activities. “Each member body determines the specific criteria for its members, in accordance with any applicable legislation or regulation” and “\[IFAC members\] carry out such programs on their own behalf, on behalf of the profession, or on behalf of governments, regulators or other agencies \[and some\] programs are carried out by another body.”

Thus, some countries have multiple members of IFAC, while in other countries the IFAC Member is not the same as the Regulatory/Licensing body. Therefore, it is proposed that the definition of “Accounting Practitioner” and subsection (1)(A) (Status of Author) of section 10.10.2 Verified Accountant Letter be amended as follows:
