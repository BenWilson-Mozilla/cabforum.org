B. Move Section 10.13.2 to Section 10.13.4 to read as follows:

10.13.4 Validation of Re-issuance Requests

A CA may rely on previously verified information to issue a replacement certificate where:

C. MOVE Section 10.13.1 to Section 10.13.2 and amend it to read as follows:

D. MOVE Section 8.3.2 to Section 10.13.1(1) so that it reads as follows:

10.13 Requirements for Re-use of Existing Documentation

10.13.1 For Validated Data

(1) The age of validated data used to support issuance of an EV Certificate (before revalidation is required) SHALL NOT exceed the following limits:

(D) Telephone number for Place of Business – thirteen months;

(E) Bank account verification – thirteen months;

(F) Domain Name – thirteen months;

(G) Identity and authority of Certificate Approver – thirteen months, unless a contract is in place between the CA and the Applicant that specifies a different term, in which case, the term specified in such contract will control.

F. In Section 10.13.3 DELETE the first clause as follows:

(3) The CA MAY issue multiple EV Certificates listing the same Subject and based on a single EV Certificate Request, subject to the aging and updating requirements stated above.

Section 13.3.2(1) to Section 10.13.1(4) so that it reads as follows:

(4) Each EV Certificate issued by the CA MUST be supported by a valid current EV Certificate Request and a Subscriber Agreement signed by the appropriate Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant or Terms of Use acknowledged by the appropriate Applicant Representative.

Section 13.3.2(2) to Section 10.13.1(2) and AMEND it, so that it reads as follows:

(2) The age of information used by the CA to verify such an EV Certificate Request MUST NOT exceed the Maximum Validity Period for such information set forth above in subsection (1), based on the earlier of the date the information was obtained (e.g., the date of a confirmation phone call) or the date the information was last updated by the QIIS, QGIS, or QTIS (e.g., if an online database was accessed by the CA on July 1, but contained data last updated by the QIIS, QGIS, or QTIS on February 1 of the same year, then the date on which the information was obtained would be considered to be February 1).

Section 13.3.2(3) to Section 10.13.1(5) so that it reads as follows:

(5) In the case of outdated information, the CA MUST repeat the verification processes required in these Guidelines.

H. DELETE Section 13.3 (Reuse and Updating Information and Documentation) and RENUMBER Section 13.4 (Data Security) to Section 13.3 and make subsequent numbering changes to Section 13.3 Data Security accordingly.
