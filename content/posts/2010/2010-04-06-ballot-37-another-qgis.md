Ballot 37 – Another QGIS (Passed Unanimously)

Motion

Tim Moses made the following motion, and Robin Alden and Jay Schiavo endorsed it:

Rules for verifying an Applicant’s place of business address are specified in Section 10.4.1 with reference to Section 10.2. Section 10.2.2 is transcribed here for the reader’s convenience. “10.2.2 Acceptable Method of Verification (1) Private Organization Subjects: All items listed in Section 10.2.1(1) MUST be verified directly with, or obtained directly from, the Incorporating or Registration Agency in the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration. Such verification MAY be through use of a Qualified Government Information Source (QGIS) operated by, or on behalf of, the Incorporating or Registration Agency, or by direct contact with the Incorporating or Registration Agency in person or via mail, e-mail, Web address, or telephone, using an address or phone number obtained from a Qualified Independent Information Source (QIIS).”

A QGIS, other than one “operated by, or on behalf of, the Incorporating or Registration Agency” (such as the SEC), should be an acceptable alternative to the QIIS and QTIS that are allowed by Section 10.4.1.
