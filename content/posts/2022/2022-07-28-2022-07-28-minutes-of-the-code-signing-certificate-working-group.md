### Membership

Visa has applied as an interested party. It was noted Visa is a CAB Forum member and an agreement is in place. No issues were noted with this application, and it was approved.

### Signing Service

Bruce is looking to turn the reformatted document into a ballot for review. Bruce would like Ian (Microsoft) to review the ballot during our next call in two weeks. Bruce does not believe any current ballots will impact the current state of the signing service ballot.
