**4. Ballot Status**

a. David Kluge (Google Trust Services) shared that the ballot proposal document is in a stage to transfer over to the Certificate Working Group (Thursday Meeting) for review and more input before a formal submission.

i. Clint Wilson suggested sharing the ballot by the Public List would be a good introduction for public discussion.

b.David Kluge shared a few comments that are still need a solution. (1) The first being the Availability Targets. There should be some and they should defined in the SLO, but the question remains “Availability measured against what?” (2) Secondly, from a technical standpoint, most agreed that it would be great to have some objective reference point (a location of a measurable point), but there is still the missing problem of what such reference points should be.

i. Trevoli Ponds (Amazon Trust Services) agreed from the comments, that an example would be confusing. There should either be a minimum or no example in the BRs. If there has to be an example, one on the website would be satisfactory.

c. Discussion around the symbols in the examples in the draft ballot are not used by all. Examples were given between different CAs to explain how the symbols and values could be confusing.

i.  The discussion focused on how clarification and understanding.
