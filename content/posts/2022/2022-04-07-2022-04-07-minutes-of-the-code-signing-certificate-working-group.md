## Minutes 

**Antitrust Statement:** Read by Dean

Minutes for the March 24th meetings were approved

### Interested party application from Insta Oy 

No comment was offered, and the application was accepted.

### Updates on Ballot CSC-13 â€“ Private Key Protection 

Bruce mentioned that the ballot received eight (8) votes and is deemed to have passed. A question was raised on the need for 15 votes to have quorum. The chair will respond to that question and the group does not believe there is an issue with the number of votes. The ballot is ready for IPR review and set to be effective November 15th. The second question was on the need to circulate a Word version of the ballot. Bruce will send that. Bruce will also check the bylaws on the requirement to circulate particular formats of the ballot.

### RFC3647 Ballot 

The question was raised to determine if ballot CSC-13 can be incorporated into the version of the requirements in RFC 3647 format. There was discussion of an extended discussion period for the re-formatting the ballot to include CSC-13, post IPR. This ballot is not intended to make any changes to the requirements, only reformat the document. There have been a number of reviewers thus far and good feedback has been provided. Reviewers include Dimitris Zacharopoulos and Joanna Fox.

### Other Business 

The question was raised on areas future ballots will look at address. The three areas for future consideration mentioned by Bruce Morton and Ian McMillan were signing services, time stamping, and high risk application processing. Ian was asked how he would prioritize these topics and he indicated:

1. Timestamping
1. Signing services
1. High risk applicants (would like to update by November 15th deadline for ballot CSC-13)

Bruce indicated the best way to get future issued to a ballot would be to put forth a proposal.

The face to face in Warsaw is still scheduled to be in person. Other events are going on in this area without issue.

Adjourned.
