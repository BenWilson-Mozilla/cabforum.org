### 5. Validation Subcommittee Update 

Corey Bonnell said that the subcommittee met last Thursday and discussed a path forward for the certificate profiles draft ballot. It was decided to move the ballot draft into the cabforum/servercert repo on GitHub. Then they discussed the improved Pandoc tooling for tables that Ryan Sleevi created in support of the profiles ballot. It will be merged into main. Finally, the subcommittee is gathering up work items discussed at the face-to-face and will be looking for volunteers to shepherd those once the profiles ballot has been moved to the cabforum repo.
