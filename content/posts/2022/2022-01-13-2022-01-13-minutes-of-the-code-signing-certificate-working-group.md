Ian thought he had sent the draft to the list before the holidays but it was determined that was not the case. He will circulate it today. Seeking 2 endorsers. Tim mentioned he had some minor comments to send to Ian. Ian asked everyone to review and if comfortable, provide an endorsement.

### **CSBR Format change** {#csbr-format-change.wp-block-heading}

Corey gave the attached presentation. The plan is to move the CSBRs as is and make normative changes after adoption.

A discussion about having multiple ballots in flight took place but it was decided to have CSC-6 move forward first, followed by this one.

Corey provided this link for the CS GitHub repository:

Dimitris presented a demo of GitHub and how to propose changes.

### **Other Business** {#other-business.wp-block-heading}

Dean said that we need to start planning for the F2F meeting. A meeting for the various chairs was taking place next week and input as to time needed for the working groups would be good input. Bruce suggested we should request 1-2 hours and we can start working on signing services.

Next meeting is on January 27th
