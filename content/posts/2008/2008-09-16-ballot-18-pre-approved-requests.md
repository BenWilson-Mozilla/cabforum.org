20. Verification of Signature on Subscriber Agreement and EV Certificate Requests

Both the Subscriber Agreement and each EV Certificate Request MUST be signed. The Subscriber Agreement MUST be signed by an authorized Contract Signer. The EV Certificate Request MUST be signed by the Certificate Requester submitting the document.
