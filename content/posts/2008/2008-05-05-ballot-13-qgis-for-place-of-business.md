The Guidelines should be amended by the following erratum.

### Erratum begins

Replace Section 16a with the following text. (a) Address of Applicant’s Place of Business (1) Verification Requirements To verify Applicant’s physical existence and business presence, the CA MUST verify that the physical address provided by

Applicant is an address where Applicant or a Parent/Subsidiary Company conducts business operations (e.g., not a mail drop or P.O. box, or ‘care of’ (C/O) address, such as an address for an agent of the Organization), and is the address of Applicant’s Place of Business.

(2) Acceptable Methods of Verification To verify the address of Applicant’s Place of Business:

(A) For Applicants whose Place of Business is in the same country as Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration:

(1) For Applicants whose Place of Business is in the same country as Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration and whose Place of Business is NOT the same as that indicated in the relevant Qualified Government Information Source used in Section (14) to verify legal existence:

(1) For Applicants listed at the same Place of Business address in the current version of either at least one Qualified Independent Information Source or a Qualified Governmental Tax Information Source, the CA MUST confirm that Applicant’s address as listed in the EV Certificate Request is a valid business address for Applicant or a Parent/Subsidiary Company by reference to such Qualified Independent Information Sources or a Qualified Governmental Tax Information Source, and MAY rely on Applicant’s representation that such address is its Place of Business; (2) For Applicants who are not listed at the same Place of Business address in the current version of either at least one Qualified Independent Information Source or a Qualified Governmental Tax Information Source, the CA MUST confirm that the address provided by Applicant in the EV Certificate Request is in fact Applicant’s or a Parent/Subsidiary Company’s business address, by obtaining documentation of a site visit to the business address, which MUST be performed by a reliable individual or firm. The documentation of the site visit MUST:

(a) Verify that Applicant’s business is located at the exact address stated in the EV Certificate Request (e.g., via permanent signage, employee confirmation, etc.); (b) Identify the type of facility (e.g., office in a commercial building, private residence, storefront, etc.) and whether it appears to be a permanent business location; (c) Indicate whether there is a permanent sign (that cannot be moved) that identifies Applicant; (d) Indicate whether there is evidence that Applicant is conducting ongoing business activities at the site (e.g., that it is not just a mail drop, P.O. box, etc.); and (e) Include one or more photos of (i) the exterior of the site (showing signage indicating Applicant’s name, if present, and showing the street address if possible), and (ii) the interior reception area or workspace

(3) For all Applicants, the CA MAY alternatively rely on a Verified Legal Opinion or a Verified Accountant Letter that indicates the address of Applicant’s or a Parent/Subsidiary Company’s Place of Business and that business operations are conducted there. (4) For Government Entity Applicants, the CA MAY rely on the address contained in the records of the QGIS in Applicant’s Jurisdiction.

(2) For Applicants whose Place of Business is in the same country as Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration and where the Qualified Government Information Source used in Section (14) to verify legal existence contains a business address for the Applicant, the CA MAY rely on the Address in the QGIS to confirm the Applicant’s or a Parent/Subsidiary Company address as listed in the EV Certificate Request, and MAY rely on Applicant’s representation that such address is its Place of Business.

(B) For Applicants whose Place of Business is not in the same country as Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration, the CA MUST rely on a Verified Legal Opinion that indicates the address of Applicant’s Place of Business and that business operations are conducted there.
