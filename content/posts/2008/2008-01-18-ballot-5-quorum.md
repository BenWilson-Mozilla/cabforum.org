Ballot 5 – Quorum (Passed Unanimously)

Motion

Tim Moses made the following motion, and Johnathan Nightingale and Nick Hales endorsed it:

“Clause 7 of the CABForum’s voting rules shall be replaced with the following clause:

‘7. A ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active members has participated. The number of currently active members is the average number of member organizations that have participated in the previous three meetings (both teleconferences and face-to-face meetings)’”

The ballot review period will come into effect upon endorsement of this motion on the Forum mail list by two other members, and will close at 1700 EST on (Friday) 11 Jan 2008. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 1700 EST on (Friday) 18 Jan 2008.

Votes must be cast by ‘reply all’ to this email.

A vote in favour of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response. A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted.

The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.
