Ballot 10 – Non-Latin Names (Passed)

Motion

The Guidelines should be amended by the following erratum.

### Erratum begins

Appendix F

Foreign Organization Name Guidelines

NOTE: This appendix is only relevant to EV applications from countries that do not have Latin character organization name registrations. More specific information for particular countries may be added to this appendix in the future.

Where an EV Applicant’s organization name is not registered with a QGIS in Latin characters and the applicant’s foreign character organization name and registration have been verified with a QGIS in accordance with these Guidelines, a CA MAY include a Latin character organization name in the EV certificate. In such a case, the CA MUST follow the procedures laid down in this appendix.

Romanized Names

In order to include a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name, the Romanization MUST be verified by the CA using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant’s jurisdiction of incorporation.

If the CA can not rely on a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant’s jurisdiction of incorporation, then it MUST rely on one of the options below, in order of preference:

· A system recognized by the International Standards Organization (ISO),

· A system recognized by the United Nations or

· A Lawyers Opinion confirming the Romanization of the registered name.

English Name

In order to include a Latin character name that is not a Romanization of the registered name in the EV certificate, the CA MUST verify that the Latin character name is:

· Included in the Articles of Incorporation (or equivalent document) filed as part of the organization registration, or

· Recognized by a QGTIS in the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation as the applicant’s recognized name for tax filings, or

· Confirmed with a QIIS to be the name associated with the registered organization, or

· Confirmed by a lawyer’s opinion letter to be the trading name associated with the registered organization.

Country Specific Procedures

F-1. Japan

In addition to the procedures set out above:

The Hepburn method of Romanization is acceptable for Japanese Romanizations.

The CA MAY verify the Romanized transliteration of Applicant’s formal legal name with either a QIIS or a lawyer’s opinion letter.

The CA MAY use the Financial Services Agency to verify an English Name. When used, the CA MUST verify that the English name is recorded in the audited Financial Statements filed with the Financial Services Agency.

When relying on Articles of Incorporation to verify an English Name, the Articles of Incorporation MUST be accompanied either: by a document, signed with the original Japanese Corporate Stamp, that proves that the Articles of Incorporation are authentic and current, or by a lawyer’s opinion letter. The CA MUST verify the authenticity of the Corporate Stamp.
