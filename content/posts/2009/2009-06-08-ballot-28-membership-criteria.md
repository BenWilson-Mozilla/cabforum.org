## Motion begins

The Forum should adopt the following membership criteria immediately upon successful completion of the ballot.

Membership criteria,

CA / Browser Forum

Version 06

Voting members of the CA/Browser Forum shall meet at least one of the following criteria.

Issuing CA:- The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs audit, or ETSI 102042 or ETSI 101456 audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, and that actively issues certificates to Web servers that are openly accessible from the Internet using any one of the mainstream browsers.

Root CA:- The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs, or ETSI 102042 or ETSI 101456 audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, and that actively issues certificates to subordinate CAs that, in turn, actively issue certificates to Web servers that are openly accessible from the Internet using any one of the mainstream browsers.

Product supplier:- The organization supplies a product that processes digital certificates and makes trust decisions for PKI relying parties (i.e. members of the general public who may act on the basis of such certificates).

Non-voting members are representatives of organizations that supply products or services that are related to the use of certificates but do not process digital certificates for relying parties, including but not limited to standards bodies, PKI component suppliers, and subscribers.
