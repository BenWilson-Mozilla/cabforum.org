(3) Contract between CA and Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate: A CA MAY verify the relationship between an Applicant and a Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate by relying on a contract between the CA and the Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate that designates the Certificate Approver with such EV Authority, provided that the contract is signed by the Contract Signer and provided that the agency and Signing Authority of the Contract Signer have been verified;

(4) Legal Opinion: A CA MAY verify the relationship between an Applicant and a Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate by relying on a Verified Legal Opinion (as described in Section 10.10.1);

(5) Accountant Letter: A CA MAY verify the relationship between an Applicant and a Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate by relying on a Verified Accountant Letter (as described in Section 10.10.2); or

(6) Corporate Resolution: A CA MAY verify the relationship between an Applicant and a Subsidiary by relying on a properly authenticated corporate resolution that approves creation of the Subsidiary or the Applicant, provided that such resolution is (i) certified by the appropriate corporate officer (e.g., secretary), and (ii) the CA can reliably verify that the certification was validly signed by such person, and that such person does have the requisite authority to provide such certification.”
