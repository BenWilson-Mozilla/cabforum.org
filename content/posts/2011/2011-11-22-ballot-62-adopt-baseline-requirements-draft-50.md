Ballot 62 – Adopt Baseline Requirements Draft 50 (Passed)

Motion

Ben Wilson made the following motion, and Bruce Morton and Eddy Nigg endorsed it:

## Motion begins

The CA/Browser Forum adopts the “Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates” Draft 50 (available here:

)

as Version 1.0 and sets an Effective Date of 1 July 2012.

It instructs the editor to restyle the draft as a Forum Guideline and arrange for it to be posted to the cabforum.org Web site.

The members expect all SSL CAs and (in particular) all member CAs to implement the resulting Forum Guideline in their operating procedures by the Effective Date.

The members request that the member browser suppliers incorporate the resulting Forum Guideline into their root-embedding program requirements as soon as is practical (but not before the Effective Date).

The members further request that the [WebTrust][1] Task Force and ETSI adapt their SSL CA audit criteria to include the resulting Forum Guidelines as soon as is practical (but not before the Effective Date).

The ballot review period comes into effect at 2100 UTC on 8 Nov ’11 and will close at 2100 UTC on 15 Nov ’11. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 2100 UTC on 22 Nov ’11. Votes must be cast by “reply all” to this email.

## Motion ends

A vote in favour of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response. A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted. The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.

Voting members are listed here:

In order for the motion to be adopted, two thirds or more of the votes cast by members in the CA category and one half or more of the votes cast by members in the browser category must be in favour. Also, at least six members must participate in the ballot, either by voting in favour, voting against or abstaining.
