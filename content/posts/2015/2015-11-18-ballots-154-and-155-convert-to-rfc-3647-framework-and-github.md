**Ballots 154 and 155 – Convert to RFC 3647 Framework and GitHub**

Ballot 154 and 155, Convert documents to RFC 3647 Framework and GitHub, closed on November 17th 2015.
The Chair received **24 votes from CAs** in which 24 were in favor, 0 against and 02 abstentions and **02 votes from Browsers** in which 02 were in favor, 0 against and 0 abstention.
Therefore, the ballot passes.

The Certificate Policy Review Working Group was chartered by Ballot 128 to (i) consider existing and proposed standards, (ii) create a list of potential improvements based on the considered standards that improve the existing CAB Forum work product, (iii) evaluate the transition to a 3647 format based on the amount of work involved.

The CP Review WG has met and concluded that the best path forward for the Forum is to complete a conversion to the RFC 3647 framework for the EV Guidelines and the Network and Certificate System Security Requirements and to post them on GitHub as the canonical versions of those documents.

Ben Wilson of DigiCert makes the following motions, and Dean Coclin from Symantec and Gerv Markham from Mozilla have endorsed them.

– – – – Motion for Ballot 154 – – – –

Be it resolved that the CA / Browser Forum directs the Certificate Policy Review Working Group to prepare a version of the EV Guidelines that moves existing content into the RFC 3647 format;
Be it further resolved that the CA / Browser Forum also directs the Certificate Policy Review Working Group to post the RFC-3647-formatted EV Guidelines on GitHub to serve, upon formal adoption by the Forum in a future ballot, as the canonical version of the EV Guidelines.
