**Ballot 147 – Attorney-Accountant Letter Changes**

Voting on Ballot 147 has closed. Here are the results:

From CA’s, we received 15 YES votes, 0 NO votes and 3 ABSTAIN votes

From Browsers, we received 1 YES vote, 0 NO votes and 0 ABSTAIN votes

The quorum has been met and the ballot passes.

**Reason for Ballot**

This is a validation working group final product that will amend the EV Guidelines to permit verification of legal existence through an attorney/accountant opinion letter. This change is based on the rationale that attorneys are the most skilled at verifying legal existence, yet are currently not permitted to do so. To ensure that a single legal letter is not the sole source of validation, language was included to require corroboration with a QIIS.
Kirk Hall of TrendMicro made the following motion, Cecilia Kam from Symantec and Jeremy Rowley from DigiCert have endorsed it.
