**Ballot 146 – Convert Baseline Requirements to RFC 3647 Framework**

Voting has closed on Ballot 146, “Convert Baseline Requirements”

Among CAs, there were 18 YES votes, 1 NO vote and 2 Abstentions
Among Browsers, there was 1 YES vote and 1 Abstention

Therefore, the ballot passes.

Here are [Version 1.3.0][1] and a helpful [Conversion Table][2]

—————————————-

The Certificate Policy Review Working Group was chartered by Ballot 128 to (i) consider existing and proposed standards, (ii) create a list of potential improvements based on the considered standards that improve the existing CAB Forum work product, (iii) evaluate the transition to a 3647 format based on the amount \[of work involved\]. One deliverable of the CP Review WG was to propose a ballot to improve CA infrastructure based on existing standards and documents and recommend whether to finish the 3647 conversion presented by Jeremy Rowley in January 2014.

The CP Review WG has met and concluded that the best path forward for the Forum is to complete a conversion to the RFC 3647 for the Baseline Requirements with an initial step that merely moves existing content from the Baseline Requirements into the RFC 3647 format.

Attached is the RFC-3647-formatted Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates.
