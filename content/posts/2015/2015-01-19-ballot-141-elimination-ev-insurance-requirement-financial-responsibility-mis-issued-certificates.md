## Ballot 141 – Elimination of EV Insurance Requirement; Financial Responsibility for Mis-Issued Certificates

Voting on Ballot 141 closed on 19 January 2015.

The Chair received “yes” votes from: Trend Micro, Mozilla, TurkTrust, WoSign, 360 Browser, Comodo, SSC, GoDaddy, Network Solutions, Chungwa Telecom, Microsoft

“No” votes by: Firmaprofessional, ANF AC, Quovadis, Opera, Startcom, Digicert, OpenTrust, Trustwave, Symantec, Secom, Entrust, Google

Therefore, Ballot 141 fails.

The following motion has been proposed by Kirk Hall of Trend Micro and endorsed by Robin Alden of Comodo and Dean Coclin of Symantec.

## Purpose

The existing insurance requirements of EV Guidelines Section 8.4 were intended to help assure the public that CAs would be financially responsible, but the requirements for Commercial General Liability and Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions insurance are not well suited for this purpose and do not apply to DV and OV certificates.

The current insurance requirements should be replaced by other, more effective financial responsibility requirements that are more directly focused on financial responsibility for potential harm to subscribers and relying parties from mis-issued certificates of all types. At present, CAs are permitted to limit their potential liability to subscribers and relying parties to $2,000 per EV certificate under EV Guidelines Section 18 and $0 per DV and OV certificate under Baseline Requirements Section 18.1.

This ballot (1) deletes the current EV insurance requirements at EV Guidelines Section 8.4, and (2) amends the EV Guidelines and the Baseline Requirements so that CAs are permitted to limit their potential liability to subscribers and relying parties to $10,000 per EV certificate, $5,000 per OV certificate, and $2,000 per OV certificate. This ballot does not otherwise change whatever legal liability a CA would or would not have for its certificates under applicable law.

## Motion begins

1. EV Guideline 8.4 is deleted.
1. EV Guideline Section 18 is amended to read as follows:
1. **Liability and Indemnification**CAs MAY limit their liability as described in Section 18 of the Baseline Requirements except that a CA MAY NOT limit its liability to Subscribers or Relying Parties for legally recognized and provable claims to a monetary amount less thantwo ten thousand US dollars per Subscriber or Relying Party per EV Certificate.

A CA’s indemnification obligations and a Root CA’s obligations with respect to subordinate CAs are set forth in the Baseline Requirements.

3. Baseline Requirements Section 18.1 is amended to read as follows:

**18.1 Liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties**

If the CA has issued and managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA’s Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA’s Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a CA MAY NOT limit its liability to Subscribers or Relying Parties for legally recognized and provable claims to a monetary amount less than two thousand US dollars per Subscriber or Relying Party per DV Certificate or less than five thousand US dollars per Subscriber or Relying Party per OV Certificate.
