The ballot has PASSED.

## Purpose of the Ballot

For Baseline Requirement for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Code Signing Certificates v2.3, the purpose is to allow the new WebTrust CSBR 2.0 or later audit scheme. The ballot allows the older WebTrust audits to continue for audit periods which start before 1 November 2020. There is no specific start date for the CSBR 2.0 audit scheme, which allows it also to be used for audit periods starting before 1 November 2021.

## Motion

1. “WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer” AND “WebTrust for Certification Authorities – Publicly Trusted Code Signing Certificates v1.0.1 or newer”; or

1. ETSI EN 319 411-1, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
