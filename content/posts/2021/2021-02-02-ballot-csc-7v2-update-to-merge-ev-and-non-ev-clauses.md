Therefore the ballot CSC-7 passes.

Purpose of the Ballot:

The CSC-2 merger of the Code Signing BRs and the EV Code Signing Guidelines was done without technical changes. The result is that we have some sections where there is different text for Non-EV and EV Code Signing certificates. In many cases there was no reason to have two different requirements. In other cases, it made sense that they both have the same requirement. There were of course some items where EV is different and these clauses were not touched for now. These items were all discussed in our bi-weekly meetings. Other minor changes were the adding in a table for document revision and history and another table for effective dates within the BRs. There were also some errors corrected from the merger.

The following motion has been proposed by Bruce Morton of Entrust, and endorsed by Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA and Dean Coclin of DigiCert.
