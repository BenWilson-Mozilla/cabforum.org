### 5. Discussion

A reminder was made of the informal poll on adoption of ECC. A link has been sent to the Management list, seeking Certificate Issuer feedback by October 8.

The declaration of participation of existing CABF member PrimeKey as an Interested Party member of SMCWG was confirmed.

Ben Wilson discussed the work of the NetSec subcommittee of the Server Cert WG. The NetSec requirements are referred to in several of the existing BRs and are likely to be included in the SMIME BR. Ben is polling feedback from members regarding the possibility of moving NetSec to become a WG in its own right. Stephen Davidson noted that some requirements were originally developed as part of the TLS BR -and lingering references to TLS sometimes complicated their being incorporated by reference in other standards. He supported the idea of some of these topics being pulled into separate documents. NetSec is one, audit might be another. The idea is that some WG would focus on cert types and others on CA topics. Ben clarified this would be a CABF ballot, requiring a WG charter, but is gaging enthusiasm at this time.

It was decided at the face-to-face that the WG would discuss the validity periods for the SMIME profiles. Some groups have proposed a default of 398 days, the gmail policy was set at 27 months, and 3 years appears to be the most common validity in use today. Any member with a position on this topic should contact Stephen, laying out the pros and cons of different proposals.

Discussion turned to the certificate profiles. Stephen noted that the WG has completed its drafting of the certificate profiles. He requested that Certificate Issuers to share these with their product and technical teams, as the next step will be to begin transforming these working papers into a draft SMIME BR.

It was noted that the approach to some fields, like OU and Pseudonym may change when we address the verification requirements, however the profiles are now considered stable.
