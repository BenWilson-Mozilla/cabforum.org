### 7. Ballot Status 

#### Ballots in Discussion Period 

_Ballot SC14:_ Updated Phone Validation Methods
Dimitris noticed that there is a possible ambiguity about the voting and whether votes must be sent to the servercert-wg or public list or both, but there is no issue related to the discussion venue of ballots. He recommended that members use the (the public list of the SCWG) since this ballot affects the SCWG, and avoid double-posting.

Doug sent a version 2 of the ballot that removed the DNS CAA location for phone numbers while waiting for IETF’s confirmation about how to define the property tags. He also replied to a couple of comments and suggested if anyone else has comments or concerns about the ballot, to send a message to the servercert-wg mailing list as soon as possible. Once these are addressed, a version 3 will be created that will hopefully be the final one before voting.

**Ballots in Review Period**
Ballot SC13: CAA Contact Property and Associated E-mail Validation Methods (Tim H.)
Dimitris mentioned that it was brought to his attention that appendix B of that ballot had a typo in the numbering and mentioned that when we create the final version of the Baseline Requirements, this typo will be corrected and it will be clear so that everyone knows about this editorial change.
