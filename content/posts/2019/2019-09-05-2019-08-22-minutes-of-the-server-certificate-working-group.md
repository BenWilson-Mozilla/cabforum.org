## Minutes



### 1. Roll Call



The Chair took attendance.

### 2. Read Antitrust Statement



The Antitrust Statement was read.

### 3. Review Agenda



No changes to the agenda.

### 4. Approval of minutes from previous teleconference 

The minutes from the previous teleconference were approved and will be circulated to the public list.

### 5. Validation Subcommittee Update



Method 6 (http) has a draft ballot that Doug posted, it is the last ballot coming from the Validation Summit, and there was some discussion about the redirects. Doug will most probably propose limiting to 10 redirects.

They also discussed about the “clean-up ballot”. There is a link pointing to the proposed changes in the minutes of the validation subcommittee, so Members can check that link for any controversial changes.

Reducing the certificate lifetime ballot was also discussed.

Finally, the subcommittee discussed about the LEI ballot which has language for the Fully-Verified (Fully Corroborated) information. More discussion already takes place on the list.

### 6. NetSec Subcommittee Update 

No update.

### 7. Ballot Status 

No further discussion on ballots under consideration

#### Ballots in Discussion Period



\_Ballot SC22: Reduce Certificate Lifetimes \_(Ryan)
Mike asked about the three-week discussion period and whether that was something decided at the Validation Subcommittee. Ryan mentioned that it was discussed at the subcommittee level for about a month and then moved to ballot in order to get any further feedback.

There was a short discussion about whether the proposer must send an e-mail to explicitly start the voting period, regardless whether the ballot e-mail states a “voting begin” date. The interpretation of the Bylaws was that an explicit email by the proposer needs to start the voting period, which must be exactly 7 days.

No additional comments

_SC21 Ballot (NSR 3): Log Integrity Controls_ (Ben)
Ben asked whether the ballots should be considered withdrawn since they have not been updated for a while. Dimitris responded that since these are still in the “Draft ballots” and have not started an official “Discussion Period”, they are not considered withdrawn, unless the proposer wants to withdraw them.

Tobi mentioned that the Network Security Subcommittee will have a better idea about these two ballots in two weeks.
