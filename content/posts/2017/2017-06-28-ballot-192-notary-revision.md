Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting is 12, so quorum was 12 votes – quorum was met.

At least one CA Member and one browser Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was met

**The ballot passes.**

**Ballot 192 – Notary Revisions**

The following motion has been proposed by Jeremy Rowley of DigiCert and endorsed by Kirk Hall of Entrust and Rich Smith of Comodo.

Currently, section 11.11.1(A)(ii) states,

11.11.1.              Verified Legal Opinion

(1)         Verification Requirements: Before relying on a legal opinion submitted to the CA, the CA MUST verify that such legal opinion meets the following requirements:

(A)         Status of Author: The CA MUST verify that the legal opinion is authored by an independent legal practitioner retained by and representing the Applicant (or an in-house legal practitioner employed by the Applicant) (Legal Practitioner) who is either:

…

(ii) A notary that is a member of the International Union of Latin Notaries, and is licensed to practice in the country of the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration or any jurisdiction where the Applicant maintains an office or physical facility (and that such jurisdiction recognizes the role of the Latin Notary);

The EV Guidelines already define “Latin Notary” appropriately and sufficiently as “A person with legal training whose commission under applicable law not only includes authority to authenticate the execution of a signature on a document but also responsibility for the correctness and content of the document. A Latin Notary is sometimes referred to as a Civil Law Notary.”

Whether a Latin Notary (or Civil Law Notary) is a member of the IULN should not be dispositive as to whether the person is competent and qualified to provide a legal opinion. The current wording of section 11.11.1(A)(ii) means we cannot accept letters from proper Latin Notaries (individuals) who aren’t members of the IULN.

By deleting the requirement that a Latin Notary be a member of the International Union of Latin Notaries, this ballot permits a more extensive view on who can provide the type of legal opinion required by the EV Guidelines.

–MOTION BEGINS–

11. Effective immediately, modify 11.11.1(A) as follows:

”’11.11.1. Verified Legal Opinion”’

(A) ”’Status of Author”’: The CA MUST verify that the legal opinion is authored by an independent legal practitioner retained by and representing the Applicant (or an in-house legal practitioner employed by the Applicant) (Legal Practitioner) who is either:

(i) A lawyer (or solicitor, barrister, advocate, or equivalent) licensed to practice law in the country of the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration or any jurisdiction where the Applicant maintains an office or physical facility, or

(ii) A notary that is a member of the International Union of Latin Notaries, and is Latin Notary who is currently commissioned or licensed to practice in the country of the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration or any jurisdiction where the Applicant maintains an office or physical facility (and that jurisdiction recognizes the role of the Latin Notary);
