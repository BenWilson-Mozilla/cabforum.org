Under Bylaw 2.2(g), a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting is 10, so quorum was 11 votes – quorum was met.

Bylaw 2.2(f) requires a yes vote by two-thirds of CA votes and 50%-plus-one browser votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both CAs and browsers.

At least one CA Member and one browser Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was met

**The ballot passes.**

**Ballot 196 – Define “Audit Period”**

**Purpose of Ballot:** It appears that CAs are sometimes confused by the phrase Audit Period. This ballot adds a definition of that phrase to the BRs, in the hope of heading off any further misunderstandings.

The following motion has been proposed by Gervase Markham of Mozilla and endorsed by Ryan Sleevi of Google and Jody Cloutier of Microsoft:

— MOTION BEGINS —

Add the following definition to section 1.6.1 of the Baseline Requirements:

**Audit Period:** In a period-of-time audit, the period between the first day (start) and the last day of operations (end) covered by the auditors in their engagement. (This is not the same as the period of time when the auditors are on-site at the CA.) The coverage rules and maximum length of audit periods are defined in section 8.1.

— MOTION ENDS —
