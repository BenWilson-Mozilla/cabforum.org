Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting is 8, so quorum was 9 votes – quorum was met.

Bylaw 2.2(f) requires a yes vote by two-thirds of CA votes and 50%-plus-one browser votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both CAs and browsers.

At least one CA Member and one browser Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was met

## The ballot passes.

## Ballot 215 – Fix Ballot 190 Errata

## Explanation

Ballot 190 inadvertently added “or a Delegated Third Party” back into section 3.2.2.4 of the Baseline Requirements, which conflicts with the results of Ballot 204 that removed it from section 3.2.2.4. This ballot re-removes “Delegated Third Party” from section 3.2.2.4 of the Baseline Requirements.

The following motion has been proposed by Ben Wilson of DigiCert and endorsed by Rich Smith of Comodo and Tim Hollebeek of Trustwave.

## Motion begins

In the Baseline Requirements v. 1.5.2., section 3.2.2.4, remove instances of “or a Delegated Third Party” and “or Delegated Third Party”, as further indicated by red strike-outs in the attached PDF file (here – [Ballot 215][1]).
