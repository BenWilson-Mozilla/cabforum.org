## RFC for Key Attestation

Mike from Entrust is trying to put together an RFC around Key Attestation. Information was circulated on the public list for anyone wanting to assist

There was a discussion on TPM 2.0 chips and similar if these are allowed or not. There’s consensus that as long as a device is FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 at the correct level, they are allowed to be used.

This will be clarified in the CSBRs in a future ballot.

## Any Other Business

Next F2F is in 6 weeks. Ian mentioned that he plans on requesting a number of Microsoft employees working close with Code Signing to join the CSWG session as well as have some guest speakers during the F2F

## Next Meeting

May 4th
