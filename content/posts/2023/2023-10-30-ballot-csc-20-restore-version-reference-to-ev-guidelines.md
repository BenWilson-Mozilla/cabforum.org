This ballot has PASSED.

## Purpose of the Ballot

This ballot updates the “Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Code Signing Certificates” version 3.4 in order to restore a version reference to the Extended Validation Guidelines which was inadvertently removed in a previous version of the Requirements. In addition, a minor typographical issue is also resolved.

The following motion has been proposed by Corey Bonnell of DigiCert and endorsed by Bruce Morton of Entrust and Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA.
