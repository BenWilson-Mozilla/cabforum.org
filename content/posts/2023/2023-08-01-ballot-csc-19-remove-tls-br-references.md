## Purpose of the Ballot {.wp-block-heading}

This ballot updates the “Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly‐Trusted Code Signing Certificates“ version 3.3 in order to remove references pointing the Baseline Requirements for Publicly-Trusted TLS Certificates (“TLS BRs”). The main goals of this ballot are to:

1. Remove dependencies with the “TLS BRs” that are decided in a different CA/B Forum Working Group
1. Remove ambiguity about which exact requirements are applicable to Code Signing Issuers and Time-stamping Authorities

The following motion has been proposed by Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA and endorsed by Martijn Katerbarg of Sectigo and Tim Hollebeek of Digicert.

## Motion {.wp-block-heading}
