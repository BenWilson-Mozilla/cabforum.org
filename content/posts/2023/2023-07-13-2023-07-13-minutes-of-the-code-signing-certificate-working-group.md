# Minutes

1 item on agenda today (since Bruce and Ian are away) – removal of BR references, and which is the correct version of X.509 to be used. Dimitris to lead discussion.

- Ballot: CSC 19
- Latest comments from Tim have been cleared, if no other concerns or objections, discussion period will start on Monday (17 July)
- No concerns raised over content, but procedural concern raised over discussion being held during summer holiday period
- If quorum is not achieved for vote (due to holiday period impact), a new ballot will be submitted with a new number (same content)
- Still waiting on feedback from Microsoft in respect to X.509 version
- Server WG requires conformance with RFC 5280 which specifically references X.509 2005 version
- Requiring latest version of X.509 is as inclusive as possible (since it already include 2005 edits) and should not present an issue

## No other business
