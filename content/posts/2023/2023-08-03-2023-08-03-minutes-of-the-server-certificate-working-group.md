1. **Introductory**

- Inigo noted the roll call and Notewell had been read at the top of the Forum call prior.
- The group reviewed the agenda for this meeting; no updates were made.
- The minutes of the 20 July meeting were reviewed and approved by the group.

2. **GitHub Issues for the Cleanup Ballot**

Inigo identified 11 open issues in the GitHub repository that needed addressing, as well as three open pull requests labeled as clean-up issues and the additional pull request that converts the EV Guidelines into RFC3647 format. He asked the working group to take a look at all of these, as he intended to prepare and submit the cleanup ballot in early September. There were no further discussion items raised around GitHub issues.

3. **Working Group Charter Change**

Ben Wilson has proposed a change to the Server Certificate Working Group charter, but Ben was not on the call. This discussion was moved forward to the next meeting of the Working Group.

4. **Ballot Updates**

Inigo noted an email from Bruce Morton regarding the review period of the latest ballot, but had not had time to review it. No other ballot updates were offered.

5. **Other Items**

No other business items were discussed. Inigo offered to cancel the 17 August Working Group meeting to match the cancellation of the Forum meeting on that date; no objections were raised.
