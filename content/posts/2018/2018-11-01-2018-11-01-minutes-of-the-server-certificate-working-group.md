### 5. Follow-up items from SCWG F2F meeting {.wp-block-heading}

None.

### 6. Validation Subcommittee Update {.wp-block-heading}

The Subcommittee continued the discussion about the limitation of validation methods via CAA, considered the result of the discussion at the F2F meeting that there is not a lot of interest and decided to drop this work item.
Another discussion item was BGP hijacking. Tim H. would raise the issue in IETF because the CA/B Forum can’t make any meaningful progress on that subject.
The Subcommittee is also preparing some ballots:

- The voting for the underscore ballot (SC12) will be initiated tomorrow night.
- Ballot for removing “any other method” for IP address is under way
- SC4 ballot going forward, which allows adding an email address for Domain Validation in DNS TXT or CAA records. Tim’s decision is to propose that both CAA and TXT is supported.

Finally, the Subcommittee discussed about possible improvements for Method 6, website control, and that’s the next item the Subcommittee will focus on.

### 7. NetSec Subcommittee Update {.wp-block-heading}

A Doodle poll was sent out to decide when the best meeting date/time is. Ben will check the results of that poll.

### 9. Any Other Business {.wp-block-heading}

_**Pending question in the questions list**_
Kirk reminded the participants that we have a pending question to respond to in the questions list. Dean said that he needs some more help with a reply. He will draft a response and send it to Ryan for comments before proceeding.

_**Comodo CA changing to SECTIGO**_
Dimitris mentioned that Comodo CA has changed its name to Sectigo and asked for comments from Comodo representatives. Tim Callan from Sectigo responded and informed the group about the new name and that the primary motivation was to avoid market confusion. He mentioned that it also helps the market to know that this is a different company, different ownership, different philosophy.
Dimitris proposed that if the Bylaws don’t specify how to handle a Member changing its name, we should ask Sectigo to sign the IPR agreement under their new name. Kirk agreed that we probably need a new IPR agreement. Tim Callan gave us his email address so we can contact him for details about the IPR agreement.
