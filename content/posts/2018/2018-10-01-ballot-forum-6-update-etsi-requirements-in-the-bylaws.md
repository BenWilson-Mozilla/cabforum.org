Under Bylaw 2.2(g), a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting is 11, so quorum was 12 votes – quorum was met.

Bylaw 2.2(f) requires a yes vote by two-thirds of CA votes and 50%-plus-one browser votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both CAs and browsers.

At least one CA Member and one browser Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was met

**The ballot passes.**

The following motion has been proposed by Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA and endorsed by Moudrick M. Dadashov of SSC and Mads Egil Henriksveen from Buypass.

**Background:**
Sections 2.1(a)(1) and 2.1(a)(2) of the Bylaws describe the qualifying criteria for “Certificate Issuers” and “Root Certificate Issuers”. This ballot attempts to remove references to the old ETSI TS documents.
**— MOTION BEGINS —**
In Sections 2.1(a)(1) and 2.1(a)(2) of the Bylaws, update the ETSI references:
“or ETSI TS 102042, ETSI 101456, or ETSI EN 319 411-1” and “ETSI EN 319 411-1102042 or ETSI TS 102042 or ETSI TS 101 456” with “or ETSI EN 319 411-1”.
**— MOTION ENDS —**
Here is a red-line of these particular changes.
(1) Certificate Issuer: The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs audit or ETSI EN 319 411-1 ~~or ETSI TS 102 042 or ETSI TS 101 456~~ audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, is a member of a CWG, and that actively issues certificates to end entities, such certificates being treated as valid by a Certificate Consumer Member. Applicants that are not actively issuing certificates but otherwise meet membership criteria may be granted Associate Member status under Bylaw Sec. 3.1 for a period of time to be designated by the Forum.
(2) Root Certificate Issuer: The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs, or ETSI EN 319 411-1 ~~102042 or ETSI TS 102 042 or ETSI TS 101 456~~ audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, is a member of a CWG, and that issues certificates to subordinate CAs that, in turn, actively issue certificates to end entities such certificates being treated as valid by a Certificate Consumer Member.
