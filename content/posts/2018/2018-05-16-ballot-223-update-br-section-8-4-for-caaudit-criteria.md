Under Bylaw 2.2(g), a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting is 9, so quorum was 10 votes. There were 29 votes total – quorum was met.

Bylaw 2.2(f) requires a yes vote by two-thirds of CA votes and 50%-plus-one browser votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both CAs and browsers.

At least one CA Member and one browser Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was met

## The ballot passes.

The following motion has been proposed by Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA and endorsed by Moudrick M. Dadashov of SSC and Tim Hollebeek from Digicert.

**Background**:

Section 8.4 of the Baseline Requirements describes the audit criteria for CAs that issue Publicly-Trusted SSL/TLS Certificates. This ballot attempts to achieve two things:

1. Remove the old ETSI TS documents
1. Align the WebTrust and ETSI requirements

“WebTrust for Certification Authorities” is equivalent to “ETSI EN 319 401” and “WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities – SSL Baseline with Network Security” combined with “WebTrust for Certification Authorities” is equivalent to “ETSI EN 319 411-1”.

## Motion begins

Replace the first two numbered items in section 8.4 from:

1. WebTrust for Certification Authorities v2.0;
1. A national scheme that audits conformance to ETSI TS 102 042 / ETSI EN 319 411-1; or

to:

1. “WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer” AND “WebTrust for CAs SSL Baseline with Network Security v2.2 or newer”; or
1. ETSI EN 319 411-1, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or

## Motion ends

The procedure for this ballot is as follows (exact start and end times may be adjusted to comply with applicable Bylaws and IPR Agreement):

From the Bylaws section 2.4(a): “If the Draft Guideline Ballot is proposing a Final Maintenance Guideline, such ballot will include a redline or comparison showing the set of changes from the Final Guideline section(s) intended to become a Final Maintenance Guideline, and need not include a copy of the full set of guidelines. Such redline or comparison shall be made against the Final Guideline section(s) as they exist at the time a ballot is proposed, and need not take into consideration other ballots that may be proposed subsequently, except as provided in Section 2.4(j) below”.
