1. **Roll Call**

1. **Antitrust Statement read by Kirk.**

1. **Review Agenda.** Agenda was approved.

1. **Approval of Minutes** of SCWG teleconference of Aug. 23, 2018. The Minutes were approved and will be posted to the Public list.

1. **Close of Voting Period for SCWG Chair**. Kirk said the voting period for SCWG Chair for 2018-2020 had ended, and Dimitris Zacharopoulos had been elected. He congratulated Dimitris.

1. **Close of Nomination Period for SCWG Vice Chai**r. Kirk said the nomination period for SCWG Vice Chair for 2018-2020 had closed, and there was only one candidate, Wayne Thayer. The election will be conducted as follows: Sept. 6-13: Discussion Period (with optional candidate statements), Sept 13-20: Voting Period. \[Note: the dated were subsequently changed.\]

1. **Membership application of eMudhra Technologies Limited**. This topic had been discussed during the prior CABF teleconference. Dimitris asked what conclusion had been reached about eMudhra’s membership application in the prior call – what form of audit was required. There was further discussion, but no agreement on how to interpret the current Bylaws on this issue as to type of audit required. Wayne asked Ben if he could draft a possible Bylaws clarification as part of the upcoming ballot to conform the Bylaws to Ballot 216.

1. **Status of SCWG Ballots to create Subcommittees** (Validation, NetSec, Certificate Policy/Policy Review). Kirk noted that under Ballot 206, the old CABF Working Groups would expire Oct. 3, and asked the old WG Chairs (Ben, Tim (not on the call), and Dimitris) if they intended to move forward with ballots to create new Subcommittees of the SCWG to replace the old WGs. If the SCWG missed the October 3 date for dissolving the old WGs, it might be possible to continue the work of the old WGs through “Committees of the Whole” of the SCWG until new Subcommittees were approved.
   Ben said that Section 5 of Ballot 206 provided a process for WGs to convert themselves to Subcommittees if the SCWG wanted them to continue. Kirk asked what process would make that happen. Ryan cited new Bylaws provisions in Section 5.3.1(e) and 5.3.4, which provide as follows:
   —
   **5.3.1 Formation of Chartered Working Groups**
   (e) CWGs may establish any number of subcommittees within its own Working Group to address any of such CWG’s business (each, a “Subcommittee”). A CWG-created Subcommittee needs to be approved by the CWG itself according to the approval process set forth in the CWG charter, but approval of the Forum is not necessary. Subcommittees must exist under an approved CWG.
   **5.3.4 Legacy Working Groups**
   Any “Legacy” Working Groups (“LWG”) in existence when this Bylaws v.1.8 is approved by the Forum shall have the option of (a) converting to a Subcommittee under a CWG pursuant to Section 5.3.1(e), (b) immediately terminating, or (c) continuing in effect without change for 6 months following such approval. For an LWG to continue beyond such 6 months, it must have a charter approved as described in Section 5.3.1 above, as if it was a new Working Group.

   Kirk said it sounded like an SCWG ballot would be required to convert the old WGs to new Subcommittees. Dimitris said he would go back and prepare a draft. While it seems a Validation Subcommittee and a Network Security Subcommittee may be needed, it was not clear about a Policy Review Subcommittee.

1. **Ballot Status**. No discussion.

1. **Any Other Business.** There was no other business.

1. **Next call**: Sept. 20, 2018 at 11:00 am Eastern Time

1. **Adjourn**
