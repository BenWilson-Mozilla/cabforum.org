The voting period for Ballot Forum-4 has ended and the ballot has passed. Here are the results.

Under Bylaw 2.2(g), a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting is 11, so quorum was 12 votes – quorum was met.

Bylaw 2.2(f) requires a yes vote by two-thirds of CA votes and 50%-plus-one browser votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both CAs and browsers.

At least one CA Member and one browser Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was met

The ballot passes.

**Purpose of Ballot**

The Governance Reform ballot (Ballot 206 under the old ballot numbering scheme) was extremely complicated and took roughly two years to draft.
The changes to the Bylaws from Ballot 216 were intended to be included in the Governance Reform ballot, but were accidentally not included.

The attached version of the Bylaws restores the important discussion period changes that were approved by the members but then accidentally overwritten.

The following motion has been proposed by Tim Hollebeek of DigiCert and endorsed by Wayne Thayer of Mozilla and Moudrick Dadashov of SSC.

— MOTION BEGINS —

This ballot replaces the “Bylaws of the CA/Browser Forum” version 1.9 with version 2.0 of those Bylaws, attached to this ballot. \[See

[Version 2.0 of Bylaws][1]\]
