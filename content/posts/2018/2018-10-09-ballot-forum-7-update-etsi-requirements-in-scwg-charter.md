The voting period for Ballot Forum-7 has ended and the ballot has passed. Here are the results.

_**Voting by CAs – 10 votes total including abstentions**_
**10 Yes votes:** Buypass, Certinomis, D-TRUST, Disig, Entrust Datacard, HARICA, Logius PKIoverheid, QuoVadis, SSC
**0 No votes:**
**1 Abstain:** Visa
_100% of voting CAs voted in favor_

_**Voting by browsers – 3 votes total including abstentions**_
**3 Yes votes:** Microsoft, Mozilla, 360
**0 No votes:**
**0 Abstain:**
_100% of voting browsers voted in favor_

Under Bylaw 2.2(g), a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting is 11, so quorum was 12 votes – **quorum was met.**

Bylaw 2.2(f) requires a yes vote by two-thirds of CA votes and 50%-plus-one browser votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. **This requirement was met for both CAs and browsers.**

At least one CA Member and one browser Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. **This requirement was met.**

## The ballot passes.

The following motion has been proposed by Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA and endorsed by Moudrick M. Dadashov of SSC and Mads Egil Henriksveen from Bypass.

Background:

Section 3 of the SCWG Charter describes the qualifying criteria for “Certificate Issuers” and “Root Certificate Issuers”. This ballot attempts to remove references to the old ETSI TS documents.

## Motion begins

In Section 3 of the SCWG Charter, update the ETSI references:

Replace “ETSI TS 102042, ETSI 101456, or ETSI EN 319 411-1”

with

“or ETSI EN 319 411-1”.

## Motion ends

Here is a red-line of these particular changes.

(1) Certificate Issuer: The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs audit, or ETSI TS 102042, ETSI 101456, or ETSI EN 319 411-1 audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, and that actively issues certificates to Web servers that are openly accessible from the Internet, such certificates being treated as valid when using a browser created by a Certificate Consumer Member. Applicants that are not actively issuing certificates but otherwise meet membership criteria may be granted Associate Member status under Bylaw Sec. 3.1 for a period of time to be designated by the Forum.

(2) Root Certificate Issuer: The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs, or ETSI TS 102042, ETSI TS 101456, ETSI EN 319 411-1 audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, and that actively issues certificates to subordinate CAs that, in turn, actively issue certificates to Web servers that are openly accessible from the Internet, such certificates being treated as valid when using a browser created by a Certificate Consumer Member. Applicants that are not actively issuing certificates but otherwise meet membership criteria may be granted Associate Member status under Bylaw Sec. 3.1 for a period of time to be designated by the Forum.
