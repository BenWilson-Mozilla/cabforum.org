Ballot CSC-4 v1: Move deadline for transition to RSA-3072 and SHA-2 timestamp tokens

Purpose of the Ballot:

The current deadline for moving from RSA-2048 to RSA-3072 and from SHA-1 to SHA-2 for timestamp tokens falls on January 1, 2021, which is inconvenient due to code freezes due to the winter holidays. This ballot delays the deadline to June 1, 2021 for RSA-3072 and April 30, 2022 for SHA-2 timestamp tokens.

The following motion has been proposed by Tim Hollebeek of DigiCert, and endorsed by Ian McMillan of Microsoft and Hugh Mercer of GlobalSign.

## Motion begins

This ballot modifies the “Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly‐Trusted Code Signing Certificates“ version 2.0 according to the attached redline.
