Ballot 72 – Reorganize EV Documents (Passed Unanimously)

Motion

Jeremy Rowley made the following motion, and Simon Labram and Rich Smith endorsed it:

… Motion begins …

The Forum adopts, with immediate effect, the document entitled “Guidelines For The Issuance And Management Of Extended Validation Certificates, Version 1.4, Draft 04” as Version 1.4 of the EV Guidelines. The Forum also adopts, with immediate effect, the document entitled “Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Code Signing Certificates” as Version 1.1 of the EV Code Signing Guidelines. The documents were circulated for review on 22 Mar 2012 and discussed during the telephone conference on 5 Apr 2012.

The Forum states that the changes which differentiate these documents from the immediately previously adopted versions (plus their errata) are intended to be entirely editorial in nature, and not to have any technical effect. If it is discovered that this goal has not been achieved, the presumption will be that the documents will be changed as quickly as possible to achieve it.

They are also available at:
