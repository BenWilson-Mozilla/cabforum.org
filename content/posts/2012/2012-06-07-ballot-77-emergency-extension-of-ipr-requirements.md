Ballot 77 – Emergency Extension of IPR Requirements (Passed)

Motion

Jeremy Rowley made the following motion, and Kirk Hall and Robin Alden endorsed it:

The Forum’s IPR Policy requires each member to sign the IPR agreement and disclose all IP assets containing an Essential Claim (as defined in the IPR) on or before June 7, 2012. A failure to comply results in the loss of forum membership. The fact that many key members have not had sufficient time to review and sign the IPR agreement will likely result in a low participation during the face-to-face in Norway and a significant delay in the discussion and adoption of on-going Forum work product.

Therefore, we move as follows:

1)The Forum’s standard ballot review and voting period are suspended for this motion, allowing the current membership to vote on this motion immediately, and

2)The deadline for members to sign the IPR Agreement is extended until 1 August 2012.

The ballot review and voting periods are waived for this motion. Voting commences immediately and closes at 7 June 2012 at 23:59 UTC.

Votes must be cast by “reply all” to this email.

A vote in favor of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response. A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted.

The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted
