Ballot 79 – Mailing List Usage (Passed)

Gervase Markham made the following motion and Chris Palmer and Eddy Nigg endorsed it:

Wishing to establish guidelines for the use of the new public mailing list,

… Motion begins….

Effective immediately, the Forum resolves that:

1. Draft and final agenda for Forum meetings (both virtual and in-person, and including any sub-groups or committees) will be posted to the public list.

1. Draft minutes of Forum meetings (both virtual and in-person, and including any sub-groups or committees) will be posted to the private list to allow members to make sure they are being correctly reported.

Minutes will be considered Final when approved at a subsequent Forum meeting, or after 2 weeks have elapsed since publication of the draft if no meeting is imminent. Final minutes will then be posted to the public list. The Chair will, upon request, make redactions of any part of the public copy of the minutes identified as private or sensitive by either the information discloser or a member mentioned or affiliated with the subject of the information.

3. Messages formally moving a Forum motion and announcing ballot outcomes, including vote and quorum counts, will be posted to the public list. The details of who voted for what will continue to be posted, now as a separate message, to the private list.

1. In other cases, individuals have discretion about which mailing list they use, but are strongly encouraged to use the public mailing list for matters other than security incidents or those which require commercial confidentiality.

Members are strongly discouraged from posting the text of private-list messages to the public list without the permission of the author. If this motion passes, the ballot outcome message will be posted to the public list under 3) above.

The ballot review period comes into effect at 21:00 UTC on 11 July 2012 and will close at 21:00 UTC on 18 July 2012. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 21:00 UTC on 25 July 2012. Votes must be cast by “reply all” to this message.

A vote in favor of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response. A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted. The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.

… Motion ends …
