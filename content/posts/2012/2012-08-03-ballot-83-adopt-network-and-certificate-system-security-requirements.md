On Ballot 83, there were “YES” votes from nine CAs and two Browsers. There were “NO” votes from four CAs and one Browser. Three CAs abstained.

Therefore, Ballot 83 passes with 69% of CAs and 66% of Browsers in favor.

Ben Wilson made the following motion, and Bill Madell and Rick Andrews endorsed it:

## Motion begins

As of 1 January 2013 (“Effective Date”), the CA/Browser Forum adopts the “Network and Certificate System Security Requirements” Ballot Draft 1 as Version 1.0. Upon adoption the Ballot Draft shall be assigned a version number of 1.0 and be posted as a Forum Guideline to the cabforum.org Web site.

The members request that those members who have worked on the Network and Certificate System Security Requirements coordinate with the WebTrust Task Force and ETSI and work on adaptations of the Network and Certificate System Security Requirements that can be incorporated into the respective WebTrust and ETSI audit criteria as soon as feasible.

The ballot review period comes into effect at 2100 UTC on 20 July ’12 and will close at 2100 UTC on 27 July ’12. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 2100 UTC on 3 Aug ’12. Votes must be cast by posting an on-list reply to this thread.

## Motion ends

A vote in favour of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response. A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted. The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.

Voting members are listed here:

with the addition of TrendMicro.

In order for the motion to be adopted, two thirds or more of the votes cast by members in the CA category and one half or more of the votes cast by members in the browser category must be in favour. Also, at least seven members must participate in the ballot, either by voting in favour, voting against or abstaining.
