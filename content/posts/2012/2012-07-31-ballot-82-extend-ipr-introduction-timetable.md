Ballot 82 – Extend IPR Introduction Timetable (Rejected)

Motion

John Espinoza made the following motion and Tim Moses and Jeremy Rowley endorsed it:

… Motion begins….

The CAB Forum hereby suspends the IPR Agreement and Policy from going into effect on August 1, 2012, as currently scheduled.

Such suspension will endure until such time as the CAB Forum’s governance revisions are complete.

Completion of the CAB Forum’s governance revisions will be deemed to have occurred in the event of a final, formal vote under the normal voting procedures of the CAB Forum then in effect where such vote concludes in the approval of a new Guideline for organization governance or other form of organization governance reform agreement.

The ballot review period comes into effect at 21:00 UTC on 19 July 2012 and will close at 21:00 UTC on 24 July 2012. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 21:00 UTC on 31 July 2012. Votes must be cast by posting an on-list reply to this thread.

… Motion ends….

A vote in favor of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response.

A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted. The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.
