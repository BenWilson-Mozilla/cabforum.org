Ballot 85 – Governance Reform (Passed Unanimously)

Motion

Pursuant to a motion made and approved at the face-to-face meeting of Forum members in Gjovik Norway, the CAB Forum has posted the four (4) governance proposals to , and indicated that one of these governance proposals, or a “no change” proposal, should be adopted by the Forum, by the following voting process:

1. A seven (7) day review period, followed by a vote on this motion;

1. A seven (7) day voting period, during which an instant run-off ballot is conducted to eliminate all but two of the proposals;

1. The instant run off ballot is among the following proposals (listed in alphabetical order):

- DigiCert Proposal
- Microsoft Proposal
- No Change Proposal
- PayPal Proposal
- Trend Micro Proposal

Note: The instant run-off ballot shall be conducted as follows:

Where there are ‘5’ initial proposals, each voting member may assign the numbers 1 to 5 to the proposals in order of preference (1 indicating their most preferred choice). Each member who votes shall (at least) assign the number ‘1’, and may assign further numbers up to and including ‘5’.

Votes ranked ‘1’ shall be counted and the proposal with the fewest votes shall be eliminated. The votes of the corresponding members shall be reassigned to the proposal ranked ‘2’ by those members. Where a member has not identified a proposal with rank ‘2’, his or her vote shall not be reassigned.

This procedure shall be repeated, counting reassigned votes, until just two proposals remain;

4. Votes will be tallied and the two remaining proposals receiving first and second status from the run-off ballot process shall proceed to the final ballot;

1. A two-week period will occur during which the authors of the two remaining proposals on the final ballot may modify their proposals while keeping to the spirit of the proposal that he or she posted to

1. A final ballot will be offered to select between the two remaining proposals, by the following voting process:

- A seven (7) day review period, followed by a seven (7) day voting period.
- Votes will be tallied and the proposal receiving a simple majority of votes in favor will be deemed the governance policy that the Forum will pursue.
- A period of undefined duration during which the author of the successful proposal shall refine the proposal in order to ensure its completeness, while keeping within the spirit of the proposal that he or she posted to .

7. A ratification ballot conducted in accordance with established Forum procedures to ratify the proposal that emerged from step 5 (above).

**MOTION BEGINS**

The members shall conduct an instant run-off ballot as described above. Votes will be tallied, and members shall conduct a final ballot between the two proposals with first and second status. Once a governance policy is selected, it will be further refined and put before the membership in the form of a ratification ballot.

This ballot review period comes into effect at 2100 UTC on 10 August 2012 and will close at 2100 UTC on 17 August 2012. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, voting on the motion will commence immediately and close at 2100 UTC on 24 August 2012. If this motion passes, the entire voting period for the 3 ballots will proceed as follows:

- 7-day voting period for the instant runoff of all options, closing on 31 August 2012
- 14-day period for modification of two final proposals, closing on 14 September 2012
- 7-day review period for two final proposals, closing on 21 September 2012
- 7-day voting period, closing on 28 September 2012

A period of undefined duration for refinement of the final proposal

- 7-day review period, closing on date TBD
- 7-day voting period, closing on date TBD

For the instant run-off ballot, votes for preferred proposals must clearly indicate a number 1 for the most preferred choice, and optionally 2 for the second most preferred, and so on (see above “Note” for details).

For the final ballot, voters will choose a preferred option between two proposals, with the winner receiving a simple majority of votes.

Votes must indicate a clear “Yes” in the response for their preferred option. Since the final ballot is for the preferred option no “no” response should be given, only a “yes” or “abstain.” A vote to abstain must indicate a clear “abstain” in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted. The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.

For the ratification ballot, votes will be tallied in accordance with established Forum procedures. Voting members are listed here:

In order for the ratification ballot conducted in step (7) above to be adopted, as the Forum is currently constituted, two thirds or more of the votes cast by members in the CA category and one half or more of the votes cast by members in the browser category must vote in favor.

Votes on this Ballot 85 must be cast by posting an on-list reply to this thread.
