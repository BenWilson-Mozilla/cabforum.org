Motion by Ben Wilson

Endorsed by Symantec and Trend Micro on 1/22/2014

Pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Bylaws, “other persons” may be invited by the Chair in the Chair’s discretion to participate in a CA/Browser Forum Meeting based on a person’s relevant expertise. In light of recent discussion and the proposed Ballot 110, which if endorsed will not complete voting until 6 February 2014, I am proposing that we invite Bruce Morton of Entrust as our Invited Guest during the working group and F2F Meeting 31 from 18-20 February 2014 and that we waive the IPR Agreement requirement for purposes of such invitation.

The basis for this request is that I have known Bruce Morton since 2005 and he was present during the early formation of the CA/Browser Forum during that time and through July 2012 when Entrust had to withdraw from participation in the CA/Browser Forum due to enforcement of the IPR Policy. Bruce Morton has deployed and managed several public and private PKIs for both government and industry for over 15 years and over the last 8 years, Bruce has managed the governance, compliance and risk management aspects of Entrust’s Certificate Services. He has indicated a desire to attend the meetings and that Entrust is planning on executing the IPR Agreement, but that due to logistics of obtaining required corporate/legal approvals to sign the IPR Agreement, he does not anticipate that the IPR Agreement will be submitted in time for Meeting 31 to be held in Mountain View, CA.

Based on these representations and for other good and valid reasons, I believe that the CA/Browser Forum should waive its requirements to sign the IPR Agreement for Bruce Morton so that he may be invited to and attend the upcoming meetings.
Therefore,

-Motion Begins-

Be it resolved that the Chair is authorized to invite Bruce Morton as an Invited Guest to Meeting 31 and associated Working Group meetings without condition that he or Entrust submit their signed IPR Agreement prior to such meetings.
