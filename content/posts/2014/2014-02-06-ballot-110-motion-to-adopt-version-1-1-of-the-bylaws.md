type: post
---

With 6 “yes” votes from CAs (Digicert, Symantec, TrendMicro, Disig, GlobalSign, and SECOM) and 2 “no” votes from Browsers (Mozilla and Google), Ballot 110 made quorum but did not pass.

On 22 January 2014, Ben Wilson of DigiCert made the following motion, endorsed by Robin Alden of Comodo and Dean Coclin of Symantec:

–Motion Begins–

Be it resolved that the CA / Browser Forum adopts the attached [CA-Browser Forum Bylaws v. 1.1- Draft3 for Ballot 110][1] as its Bylaws, effective as of 6 February 2014.

–Motion Ends–

The review period for this ballot shall commence at 2100 UTC on 23 January 2014 and will close at 2100 UTC on 30 January 2014. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 2100 UTC on 6 February 2014.

Votes must be cast by posting an on-list reply to this thread. A vote in favor of the ballot must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response. A vote against the ballot must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response. A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted. The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.

Voting members are listed here: /members/. In order for the motion to be adopted, two thirds or more of the votes cast by members in the CA category and more than one half of the votes cast by members in the browser category must be in favor. Quorum is currently six (6) members– at least six members must participate in the ballot, either by voting in favor, voting against, or by abstaining for the vote to be valid.
