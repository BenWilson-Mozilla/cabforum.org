title: Ballot 114 – Improvements to the EV Definitions(passed)
type: post
---

Voting on Ballot 114 closed on 28 January 2014 with votes cast as follows:

Yes: ANF, Buypass, CERTUM, Comodo, DigiCert, GlobalSign, Logius PKIoverheid, QuoVadis, Symantec, Trend Micro, Trustis, TURKTRUST and Mozilla.
No: None.
Abstain: None.
Result: Ballot passes

Cecilia Kam from Symantec made the following motion, and Jeremy Rowley from DigiCert and Kirk Hall from Trend Micro endorsed it.

This proposal clarifies the definition of Business Entities, Private Organizations, and Incorporating Agencies. The change to Business Entity fixes the omission of non-commercial entities and clarifies that the examples are not all-encompassing. The Private Organization change helps promote EV in countries where they don’t generally use the term “Incorporating Agency”. The change in Incorporating Agency gives the guidelines a more international focus by using the term formation over incorporation and by acknowledging that businesses are generally registered, not established, with a filing.

**— Motion begins —**

Effective immediately, the following changes are made to Section 4 of the EV Guidelines:

Business Entity: Any entity that is not ~~neither~~ a Private Organization, ~~nor a~~ Government Entity, or Non-Commercial Entity as defined herein. Examples include, but are not limited to, general partnerships, unincorporated associations, ~~and~~ sole proprietorships, etc.

Private Organization: A non-governmental legal entity (whether ownership interests are privately held or publicly traded) whose existence was created by a filing with (or an act of) the Incorporating Agency or equivalent in its Jurisdiction of Incorporation.

Incorporating Agency: In the context of a Private Organization, the government agency in the Jurisdiction of Incorporation under whose authority the legal existence of the entity is registered ~~Private Organizations is established~~ (e.g., the government agency that issues ~~Certificates of Incorporation~~ certificates of formation or incorporation). In the context of a Government Entity, the entity that enacts law, regulations, or decrees establishing the legal existence of Government Entities.

**— Motion Ends —**
