## Reasons for proposed ballot

The EV Guidelines currently allow verification of agency through the applicant’s human resources department by calling an independently verified telephone number and verifying employment. This process does not always work smoothly. Often employment verification is outsourced to a third party service provider, or HR person refuses to answer without taking specific procedural steps, and CA ends up asking to speak with IT department or managers within applicant’s organization in order to obtain the needed confirmation.

The proponents of this ballot believe that the proposed modification to this method of confirmation (contacting others within the applicant’s organization, in addition to HR) is sufficiently trustworthy. This would still be performed by calling the applicant, at its publicly recognized phone number, and verifying employment of the applicant representative (Contract Signer or Certificate Approver) with someone other than the individual about whom the information is sought.

## -MOTION BEGINS

Subsection (2)(A) of section 11.7.2 of the Extended Validation Guidelines (Acceptable Methods of Verification – Name, Title and Agency) would be amended as follows:

**(2) Agency:** The CA MAY verify the agency of the Contract Signer and the Certificate Approver by:

(A) Contacting the Applicant\*\*\[STRIKE–‘s Human Resources Department\]\*\* by phone or mail\*\*\[INSERT\*\* **,\]** **\[STIKE (\]** at the phone number or address for the Applicant\*\*\[STRIKE–‘s Place of Business,\]\*\* **\[INSERT–**obtained and**\]** verified in accordance with **\[STRIKE–these Guidelines\]** \[INSERT **Section 11.4.1 or 11.4.2**) and obtaining confirmation that the Contract Signer and/or the Certificate Approver, as applicable, is an employee; or
. . .

The resulting subsection 11.7.2(2) would read as follows:

(2) Agency: The CA MAY verify the agency of the Contract Signer and the Certificate Approver by:

(A) Contacting the Applicant by phone or mail, at the phone number or address for the Applicant, obtained and verified in accordance with section 11.4.1 or 11.4.2, and obtaining confirmation that the Contract Signer and/or the Certificate Approver, as applicable, is an employee; or
