**Ballot 124 – Business Entity Clarification**

Voting closed on June 5, 2014. We received votes in favor from Actalis, ANF, Buypass, DigiCert, Disig, Firmaprofesional, GlobalSign, GoDaddy.com, Logius PKIoverheid, Mozilla, QuoVadis, StartCom, Symantec, Trend Micro, TURKTRUST, OpenTrust, and WoSign. There were no votes against and no abstentions.

Therefore, Ballot 124 passed.

The EV Guidelines Working Group identified an erroneous cross-reference in the first sentence of Section 11.2.2(3) (Business Entity Subjects).

Joanna Fox of GoDaddy made the following motion, and Cecilia Kam of Symantec and Ben Wilson from DigiCert have endorsed it.

**Reasons for Proposed Ballot**

Currently, Section 11.2.2(3) of the EV Guidelines implies that ALL subsections of section 11.2.1(3) apply, whereas subsection (D) only applies to certain types of entities.

Therefore, this change is needed to correctly state the requirement.

**Motion Begins**

In the first sentence of Section 11.2.2(3) (Business Entity Subjects),

DELETE “All items listed in Section 11.2.1(3) above,” and

INSERT “Items listed in Section 11.2.1(3) (A) through (C) above”

so that the resulting sentence reads,

“Items listed in Section 11.2.1(3) (A) through (C) above MUST be verified directly with, or obtained directly from, the Registration Agency in the Applicant’s Jurisdiction of Registration.”

**Motion Ends**

The review period for this ballot shall commence at 2200 UTC on Thursday, May 22, 2014, and will close at 2200 UTC on Thursday, May 29, 2014.

Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 2200 UTC on Thursday, June 5, 2014. Votes must be cast by posting an on-list reply to this thread.

A vote in favor of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response.

A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response.

A vote to abstain must indicate a clear ‘abstain’ in the response. Unclear responses will not be counted.

The latest vote received from any representative of a voting member before the close of the voting period will be counted.

Voting members are listed here: [/about/membership/members/](/about/membership/members/)

In order for the motion to be adopted, two thirds or more of the votes cast by members in the CA category and more than one half of the votes cast by members in the browser category must be in favor. Quorum is currently six (6) members– at least six members must participate in the ballot, either by voting in favor, voting against, or by abstaining for the vote to be valid.
