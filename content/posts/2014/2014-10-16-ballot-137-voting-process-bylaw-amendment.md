The single nominee is considered confirmed if a majority of the Forum members who vote are in favor of the appointment, regardless of the number of votes cast and irrespective of whether 2/3 of the CAs or 1/2 of the product suppliers approve appointment of the nominee.

If more than one candidate is nominated for Chair or Vice Chair, the Forum will announce an election ballot to determine which candidate will fill the position. upon close of nominations, Within two weeks after the close of the nomination period, the Chair or Vice Chair will establish an election committee and announce the election ballot on the management mailing list along with the ballot start date, ballot end date, and a description of the voting process. The Chair or Vice Chair will appoint the election committee by selecting at least two volunteers who have a reputation for independence, preferably individuals without voting rights in the Forum and that participate as Interested Parties. The election committee is responsible solely for tallying Forum Member votes in connection with the election ballot. The description must include the email address(es) where members will send their vote, which should be the email addresses of the election committee. ballot will be held in the regular manner to select the new Chair. If the election of a new Chair means the office of Vice Chair becomes vacant, the Members may nominate themselves or other candidates to the office of Vice Chair, and a ballot will be held in the regular manner to elect the new Vice Chair.

For election ballots, each Forum Member is entitled to a single vote regardless of the number of participating Forum Member representatives or whether the Forum Member is categorized as a CA or product supplier. If multiple votes are received from a Forum Member’s representatives, the last vote submitted during the voting period is considered the Forum Member’s vote. Within two weeks after the election ballot closes, the election committee will compile the votes, ensure that only one vote is counted per Forum Member, confirm the results with other members of the election committee, and publish the ballot results by sending an email to the public mailing list. The election committee will not include any votes submitted before or after the voting period when compiling the votes. The ballot results email will contain only the following information: a short description of the ballot purpose, the total number of votes submitted during the ballot period, and the name of the nominee receiving the most votes. The election committee may include other language as necessary to accurately describe the ballot and any concerns the election committee had with the ballot, provided that such language does not disclose how individual Forum Members voted. The election committee will treat the votes of individual Forum Members as confidential information. The nominee receiving the most votes is appointed to the applicable position, regardless of the number of votes cast and irrespective of whether 2/3 of the CAs or ½ of the product suppliers voted for the nominee. If the election ballot results in a tie among the candidates receiving the most votes, the Chair or Vice Chair will call for another election ballot that includes only the two tying candidates.
