**Reasons for proposed ballot**

The CABF has asked ETSI for a procedure to identify qualified, ETSI-accredited auditors in order to ensure that audits are properly managed.

The proponents of this ballot believe that the proposed modification to this section makes it more accurate because it refers to a single, reliable source (Annex E of ETSI TS 102 042).

(While ETSI will include on its web site the accredited audit bodies, the definitive information on ETSI auditor accreditation can be obtained from the relevant national accreditation body, which should be contacted for formal confirmation. Accreditation information is generally available on the web site of the national accreditation body, or often it can also be checked on the auditing body’s web site, if they have been properly accredited.)

—MOTION BEGINS—

Bullet 4 of section 17.6 of the Baseline Requirements document (Auditors qualifications) would be amended as follows:

4. (For audits conducted in accordance with any one of the ETSI standards) accredited in accordance with Annex E of ETSI TS 102 042 119 403, or accredited to conduct such audits under an equivalent national scheme, or accredited by a national accreditation body in line with ISO 27006 to carry out ISO 27001 audits;

The resulting provision would read:

“4. (For audits conducted in accordance with any one of the ETSI standards) accredited in accordance with Annex E of ETSI TS 102;”
