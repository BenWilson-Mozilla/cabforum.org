## Ballot 113 – Revision to QIIS in EV Guidelines

Voting ended on 13 January 2014. Quorum was 6 and 21 votes were cast—20 by CAs and 1 by Browsers.  Twenty votes were in favor of the amendment. Izenpe abstained. Therefore, the ballot passes.

The following proposal comes from EV working group.

Jeremy Rowley made the following motion, and Rich Smith and Kirk Hall have endorsed it.

This ballot proposes a replacement to Section 11.10.5 of the Extended Validation Guidelines, which defines the qualifications of a QIIS. The previous QIIS definition did not accurately capture current CA practices. In fact, a strict reading of the existing definition might imply that CAs were prohibited from using Dun & Bradstreet, Hoovers, and other commercially reliable sources generally regarded as accurate sources of information. The proposed definition consolidates confusing and overlapping requirements while clarifying the QIIS verification requirements for CAs. The new definition permits CAs to use databases of information if the CA has documented its process to verify the data’s accuracy and the CA knows the information is not self-reported.

**— Motion begins —**

Effective immediately:

Replace Section 11.10.5 in the EV Guidelines:

**11.10.5 Qualified Independent Information Source**

A Qualified Independent Information Source (QIIS) is a regularly-updated and current, publicly available, database designed for the purpose of accurately providing the information for which it is consulted, and which is generally recognized as a dependable source of such information. A commercial database is a QIIS if the following are true: (1) Industry groups rely on the database for providing accurate location or contact information; (2) The database distinguishes between self-reported data and data reported by independent information sources; (3) The database provider identifies how frequently they update the information in their database; (4) Changes in the data that will be relied upon will be reflected in the database in no more than 12 months; and (5) The database provider uses authoritative sources independent of the Subject, or multiple corroborated sources, to which the data pertains. Databases in which the CA or its owners or affiliated companies maintain a controlling interest, or in which any Registration Authorities or subcontractors to whom the CA has outsourced any portion of the vetting process (or their owners or affiliated companies) maintain any ownership or beneficial interest do not qualify as a QIIS. The CA MUST check the accuracy of the database and ensure its data is acceptable.

With the following proposed language for Section 11.10.5:

**11.10.5 Qualified Independent Information Source**

A Qualified Independent Information Source (QIIS) is a regularly updated and publicly available database that is generally recognized as a dependable and accurate source for certain information. A database qualifies as a QIIS if the CA determines that: (1) Industries other than the certificate industry rely on the database for accurate location, contact, or other information; and (2) The database provider updates its data on at least an annual basis. The CA SHALL use a documented process to check the accuracy of the database and ensure its data is acceptable, including reviewing the database provider’s terms of use. The CA SHALL NOT use any data in a QIIS that the CA knows is (i) self-reported and (ii) not verified by the QIIS as accurate. Databases in which the CA or its owners or affiliated companies maintain a controlling interest, or in which any Registration Authorities or subcontractors to whom the CA has outsourced any portion of the vetting process (or their owners or affiliated companies) maintain any ownership or beneficial interest, do not qualify as a QIIS.
