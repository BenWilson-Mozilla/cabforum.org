title: Baseline Requirements 1.1.7 and 1.1.8 Re-Posted
type: post
---

A couple of formatting errors were identified in the Baseline Requirements, and versions 1.1.7 and 1.1.8 have been replaced with corrected versions. Appendix A in versions prior to version 1.1.7 had parts of RSA public key exponent requirements as superscript. It should have read: “The CA SHALL confirm that the value of the public exponent is an odd number equal to 3 or more. Additionally, the public exponent SHOULD be in the range between 216+1 and 2256-1.” That is corrected in version 1.1.7. Also, versions 1.1.7 and 1.1.8 had combined the text at the end of section 11.1.4 as part of the title of section 11.2. That has been corrected in those two versions.
