Ballot 157 – Adopt version 1.2 of the Intellectual Property Rights Policy

The PAG has completed its review of the IPR Policy, and the PAG recommends that the Forum adopt the attached v. 1.2 of the IPR Policy. Therefore, the following resolution has been proposed by PAG Chair Ben Wilson of Digicert and endorsed by PAG members Scott Peterson of Google and Virginia Fournier of Apple.
