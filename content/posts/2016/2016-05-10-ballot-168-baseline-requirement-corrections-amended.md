**Ballot 168: Baseline Requirements Corrections (Revised)**

The following motion has been proposed by Peter Bowen of Amazon and endorsed by Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA and Rich Smith of Comodo:

**Background:**

A number of small corrections and clarifications to the Baseline Requirements have been identified. These are, in general, changes that reflect the existing understanding of the Baseline Requirements by the Forum. Due to the understanding that these primarily represent existing practice, they are combined for efficiency.

**— MOTION BEGINS —**

Effective the date of passage, the following modifications to the Baseline Requirements are adopted:

In Section 1.6.1:

- In the definition of “Applicant Representative”, replace “and agrees to the Certificate Terms of Use” with “the Terms of Use” and append “or is the CA” at the end of the definition;

- In the definition of “Terms of Use”, append “or is the CA” at the end of the definition;

In Section 1.6.3:

- Delete X.509v3

- Insert “X.509, Recommendation ITU-T X.509 (10/2012) | ISO/IEC 9594-8:2014 (E), Information technology – Open Systems Interconnection – The Directory: Public-key and attribute certificate frameworks.”

Move the content in section 3.3.1 to section 4.2.1 to become the third paragraph in 4.2.1 and leave section 3.3.1 blank.

The CA may include information in this field that differs slightly from the verified name, such as common variations or abbreviations, provided that the CA documents the difference and any abbreviations used are locally accepted abbreviations; e.g., if the official record shows “Company Name Incorporated”, the CA MAY use “Company Name Inc.” or “Company Name”.

Replace “Subordiate” with “Subordinate” in the title of 7.1.6.3.
