**Ballot 174 – Reform of Requirements Relating to Conflicts with Local Law**

The following motion has been proposed by Gervase Markham of Mozilla and endorsed by Kirk Hall of Entrust and Moudrick Dadashov of SSC:

**Statement of Intent:** The purpose of this change is to reform section 9.16.3 of the BRs, titled “Severability”, which deals with what a CA must do when it encounters a conflict between the requirements of a jurisdiction under which it operates and the requirements of the BRs. At the moment, this clause is triggered only by a court determination rather than by the CA encountering a conflict, which makes it unlikely to ever be triggered, and it requires notification to the CAB Forum but not documentation of the outcome. The current clause is:

9.16.3. Severability

If a court or government body with jurisdiction over the activities covered by these Requirements determines that the performance of any mandatory requirement is illegal, then such requirement is considered reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal. This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to the laws of that jurisdiction. The parties involved SHALL notify the CA / Browser Forum of the facts, circumstances, and law(s) involved, so that the CA/Browser Forum may revise these Requirements accordingly.
**–Motion Begins–**

Delete section 9.16.3 from the Baseline Requirements in its entirety and replace it with the following:

9.16.3. Severability

In the event of a conflict between these Requirements and a law, regulation or government order (hereinafter ‘Law’) of any jurisdiction in which a CA operates or issues certificates, a CA MAY modify any conflicting requirement to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal in the jurisdiction. This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to that Law. In such event, the CA SHALL immediately (and prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) include in Section 9.16.3 of the CA’s CPS a detailed reference to the Law requiring a modification of these Requirements under this section, and the specific modification to these Requirements implemented by the CA.

The CA MUST also (prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) notify the CA/Browser Forum of the relevant information newly added to its CPS by sending a message to and receiving confirmation that it has been posted to the Public Mailing List and is indexed in the Public Mail Archives available at (or such other email addresses and links as the Forum may designate), so that the CA/Browser Forum may consider possible revisions to these Requirements accordingly.

Any modification to CA practice enabled under this section MUST be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or these Requirements are modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously. An appropriate change in practice, modification to the CA’s CPS and a notice to the CA/Browser Forum, as outlined above, MUST be made within 90 days.

CAs are required to make this change to their processes by a date 90 days from the date this ballot passes.
