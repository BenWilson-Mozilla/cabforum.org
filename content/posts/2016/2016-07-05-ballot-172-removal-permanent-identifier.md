**Ballot 172 – Removal of permanentIdentifier from EV Code Signing Guidelines**

The following motion has been proposed by Bruce Morton of Entrust and endorsed by Rick Andrews of Symantec and Jeremy Rowley of DigiCert:

Background:

The EV Code Signing Guidelines require a SAN which includes the permanentIdentifier. The permanentIdentifier is not used by any browser or operating system. Therefore, it is proposed that the permanentIdentifier requirement be removed from the EV Code Signing Guidelines.

–Motion Begins–

Effective upon the date of passage, the following modifications are made to the EV Code Signing Guidelines:

Section 9.2.2 - Replace all contents with “No stipulation.”

Section 9.7 (B): - Remove section 9.7 (B).

–Motion Ends–

The review period for this ballot shall commence at 2200 UTC on 21 June 2016, and will close at 2200 UTC on 28 June 2016. Unless the motion is withdrawn during the review period, the voting period will start immediately thereafter and will close at 2200 UTC on 5 July 2016.

A vote in favor of the motion must indicate a clear ‘yes’ in the response. A vote against must indicate a clear ‘no’ in the response.
