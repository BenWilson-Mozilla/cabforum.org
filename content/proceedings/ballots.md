Beginning with the adoption of the Extended Validation Guidelines in June 2007, the CA/Browser has tracked proposed ballots using a numbering system, and CA/Browser Forum member votes have become publicly available for votes occurring after February 2013. A tally of quorum and voting results is available here: Â [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjuWQ0oWc2scdDV5QWd5OGk1VWFfZW5XbWdDX1JqN2c#gid=4](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjuWQ0oWc2scdDV5QWd5OGk1VWFfZW5XbWdDX1JqN2c#gid=4 "CAB Forum Voting Record")
