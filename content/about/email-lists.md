## Forum Discussions are Now Public {#Forum_Discussions_are_Now_Public}

The CA/Browser Forum has several public mailing lists, intended to be used for normal CA/Browser Forum discussions.

They are:

- the **Public** list, which is for general Forum business, ,
- the **Server Certificate Working Group** list, [https://lists.cabforum.org/mailman/listinfo/servercert-wg][1],
- the **Code Signing Certificate Working Group** list, , and
- the **SMIME Certificate Working Group** list, .

The activity on these lists can be followed by the public, but not posted to, unless they are an Interested Party. An Interested Party must review and accept the [Forum’s IPR Policy][2] and submit the signed IPR Policy Agreement ([CAB Forum Agreement for IPR Policy v.1.3][3]) to the CA/Browser Forum Chair.

Questions from the public may be submitted by email to **the Questions list** at ‘\[questions at cabforum.org\]’.

We also maintain other email lists, including the following:

- A management listserv for communications member-to-member and with official liaisons;
- A [**Validation** mailing list][4] for members of the Validation Working Group and those working on improvements to validation processes in CA/B Forum Guidelines – [click here to subscribe][5]; and
- A [**Network Security subgroup** mailing list][6] for members of the Validation Working Group and those working on improvements to Forum’s [Network and Certificate System Security Requirements][7].
