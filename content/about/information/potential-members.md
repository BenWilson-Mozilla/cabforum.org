## **About the CA/Browser Forum**

The CA/Browser Forum conducts business primarily at the working group level, although voting on a working group charter is by a plenary of the Forum.

- Members may propose by ballot the chartering of Working Groups open to participation by Members and Interested Parties. The ballot shall outline the scope of the Working Group’s activities, including deliverables, any limitations, and Working Group expiration date. Details are available in Section 5.3.1 of the [Bylaws][1]. Upon approval of the Working Group, its Chair is elected by majority vote of its members (or chosen as otherwise specified in the charter). The Chair then sends an invitation for an initial meeting and seeks participation of eligible Members, Associate Members and Interested Parties (as specified in the charter) with expertise and interest in the Working Group’s subject matter.  Working Groups may establish separate list-servs, wikis, and web pages for their communications, but all such separate list-servs must be managed in the same fashion as the Public Mail List.

- Working Groups may meet by teleconference or face-to-face meetings. They adopt Final Guidelines and Final Maintenance Guidelines within the scope of their charters and according to the provisions (including voting processes) of their charters. Any Final Guideline or Maintenance Guideline is then posted to the Public Mail List. Final Maintenance Guidelines and new Final Guidelines must pass through a 30-day and 60-day Intellectual Property Rights review period before they are final, however they do not need to be approved by the Forum at large.

## **Membership Criteria**

**All CA/Browser Forum members must meet the membership criteria of at least one Chartered Working Group (CWG). Generally, they must meet the following criteria:**

- Certificate Issuer: The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs audit or ETSI EN 319 411 audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, is a member of a CWG, and that actively issues certificates to end entities, such certificates being treated as valid by a Certificate Consumer Member. Applicants that are not actively issuing certificates but otherwise meet membership criteria may be granted Probationary Member status under Bylaw Sec. 3.3 for a period of time to be designated by the CWG.
- Certificate Consumer: The member organization produces a software product, such as a browser, intended for use by the general public for relying upon certificates and is a member of one of the CWGs ([Server Certificate WG][2], [Code Signing Certificate Working Group][3], or [S/MIME Certificate Working Group][4]).
- Six-month Probationary Period: For the Server Certificate WG, there is a six-month probationary period for new members. During the probationary period, the applicant organization must attend at least 30% of the Server Certificate WG teleconferences (not counting subcommittee meetings) and at least one face-to-face meeting of the working group (either physically or virtually).

**Additional membership criteria are stated in each CWG’s charter.**

**Any individual or organization that does not qualify for voting membership in a chartered working group may participate as an [Interested Party][5].
**

In addition, the CA/Browser Forum may enter into associate member relationships with other organizations when the Forum determines that maintaining such a relationship will be of benefit to the work of the Forum. Associate membership is defined in section 3.1 of the Forum [Bylaws][1].
