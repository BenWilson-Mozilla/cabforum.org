The CA/Browser Forum is governed by [Bylaws][1], which were first adopted in 2012. The Bylaws set forth the qualifications for [Membership in the Forum][2], and the types of participation that are allowed for non-voting members, interested parties, and others.  The Forum is an unincorporated association of separate organizations.

All active participants in CA/Browser Forum activities must agree to the Forum’s [Intellectual Property Rights Policy][3], also adopted in 2012.

The Forum elects [Officers][4] — a Chair, who serves a two-year term, and a Vice Chair. The Chair and Vice Chair manage the [Meetings][5] of the Forum and act as the Forum’s official representatives.

The Forum communicates through a variety of means, such as [email lists][6], telephone calls, face-to-face meetings, and this web site. As stated generally in section 1 of the Forum’s Bylaws, the CA/Browser Forum advances industry best practices to improve the ways that certificates are used to the benefit of Internet users and the security of their communications.
